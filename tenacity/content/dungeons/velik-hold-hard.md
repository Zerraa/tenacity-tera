<h3>First Boss: Kavador</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Nightmare Roly Poly** - He will randomly target a party member and roll in straight path and a message will appear: 

     “Doom!”

* He will do this 3 times. Then, he will bury underground and pop up near the person with aggro.
  * This attack is instant death.

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Right/Left Scratch** - Attacks the person with aggro. Nothing special.

**Fury Swipes** -  hit attack. Alternates right and left 6 times.

**Clap** - His eyes will flash red, signalling this attack. This attack will inflict stun, so it must be iframed.
* It cannot be blocked.
* Inflicts Stun

**Sonic Spin** - His eyes will flash red, curl up and spins like sonic. This attack tends to move through tanks at the end despite holding block up, but sometimes it won’t.

**Stunning Pounce** - He will jump backward, then leap forward to stun anyone who gets hit. This must be iframed. 
* If someone is stunned, the boss will face that person to attack with fury swipes.
  * In Hard mode, the stun **CANNOT** be cleansed.
  * **Quite deadly, but can survive through it with healer’s proper support.**

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Reinforcements** - The message : 

     “Kavador calls for reinforcements”
    
Will appear on the screen.He will roar and then jump up to slam on the ground. This attack covers entire field, so you must time your iframe. 
* Then, similar to how Fulminar had Pizza cutter mechanic, this one also summons blue Argonhogs around the map which will roll straight across like sonic. 
  * Oneshot in Hard mode.

**Bad Breath** - He will sideswipe to turn to a random target. 
* Then he will lock onto the person with secondary aggro to spit out a large cone shaped AoE.
  * Hurts a lot in Hard mode.
  
**Fart** - You will notice purple gas building up around him. He will fart in a straight line behind as soon as his wings flap a bit.

<h3>Second Boss: Prokyon</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Rock Pile** - At certain point of combat, he will jump up then land with a huge pile of rocks. When he lands, you will receive moderate damage and get pushed back. 
* **PLEASE DO NOT BREAK THE ROCK PILE.** If you do not have at least 1 of these, your raid is doomed for wipe mechanic. 
  * Try to move away from the rock pile as you fight the boss.
  * Any attack can potentially destroy it, so moving away from the debris is a must so that everyone can safely DPS without damaging the debris.
* The recommended positioning is to form a line in a order of tank – boss – party – rock pile. The tank can choose to circle around the map as the boss places rocks on the map.

**“You’re no fun anymore.”** - Same as Debris mechanic where he jumps up to place down a pile of rocks. 
* However, you will notice that he will target a random person indicated by secondary aggro. 
  * He will jump toward this person instead of landing in place.

**Hide and Seek** - With the message :

     “Begone! And never come back!”

With this quote, he will lift his right arm and there will be a straight blue line stretching from any rock piles indicating a safe zone.
* This is when you must hide behind the rock pile (inside the blue line) to avoid the full room AoE — you have roughly 6 seconds to do so. It will kill you instantly.
  * **TL;DR : Run to blue zone**

**Away with you** - With message : 

     “Argh! Away with you!”
     
All of the debris will detonate in 10m(?) radius.
* Oneshot

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Right foot, Left Foot** – He will stomp right foot then left foot toward the person with aggro.

**Right swing, Left Swing** – He will swipe with his right arm then left arm toward the person with aggro.

**Side Swing** – He will look on his right or left side and throw rocks almost immediately as he swings his right or left arm depending on the direction of which side he looked over.
* Simply iframe it.

**Back Swing** – He will look behind over his right or left shoulder and throw rocks behind him as he swings his right or left arm depending on the direction of which shoulder he looked over. 
* Simply iframe it.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Hammer** – Concentrates rocks from his body to form a hammer on his right hand, then slams toward person with aggro.
* Make sure this attack DOES NOT hit the rock pile.

![](https://i.imgur.com/IHwN3Tk.jpg)

**Laser** - He will randomly target one person and continuously aim at that person until it fires a laser. 
* The laser will also leave a trail, inflicting damage if stepped on.
  *  Be careful NOT to aim where the rock pile is.)

**Boulder Throw** - Creates a boulder from its body and slams it in front. 
* Simply iframe it. Cannot be blocked.

<h3>Last Boss: Veldeg</h3>

Really pay attention to your surroundings so that you do not position yourself to a disadvantage. Your combat zone will be limited and it may put quite a bit of stress on healer if they or other party members are not experienced enough with the game.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Pylons** - Once it is destroyed, it will create a large engraving that inflicts damage if you stand on it when the engraving on the floor is filled up. 
* This limits your combat area, so be careful!
  * In Hard Mode, the puddles are much larger, and it inflicts 200k damage.
  * Also, in Hard mode, there is an achievement for defeating Veldeg after breaking all pylons before the boss HP falls below 50%.

![](https://i.imgur.com/MohmB0k.jpg)

**Smash** With quote : 

     “Smash”

Then he will aim at one of the pylons to destroy it. There’s no way to stop him from doing this. Don’t chase after him as he will return to the person with aggro.

**Boom!** - With quote : 

     “Boom!”

A full room AoE attack. Iframe after he lifts both hands above his head to slam the ground for massive attack. 
* You can ignore this and continue to DPS as long as you get healed; HOWEVER, do keep track of this attack because on **every 3rd time he use this attack, you will be knocked airborne if you fail to iframe it.**
* He will immediately follow up with a body slam which will push you back. If you happen to land on the puddle made by destroyed pylon, you are good as dead. The timing to avoid this is to iframe a bit after he jumps. 
  * Also, if someone did not die from getting knocked airborne, the boss will randomly target anyone who was airborne to spit at that person to make sure his target is dead.

**Dispel phase** - With the message of : 

     “Beware…”
     
A fiery AoE will surround him at 10m radius which will inflict 10k per tick. Healers must watch the boss’s buff bar as he will gain a 6 second debuff that looks like Berserker’s Leaping strike icon. 
* **When he has this buff, the healer must use Plague of Exhaustion or Regression to remove this buff.**
  * Since he will receive this buff twice, it is a good idea to assign the order in which healer will dispel it first. 
* **Failure to dispel his buff will result in possibility of wipe as it will buff him tremendously.** After the 6 seconds are up he will do a huge AoE attack.

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Left Axe** – Strikes with his left arm once.

**Right Hammer and Single Slam** – Strikes with his right arm once, then gathers both arms to slam once.

**Right Hammer and Left Swipe** – Strikes with his right arm once and briefly pauses before he delivers a full swing with his left hand.

**Left Axe and Double Slam** – Chops the person with aggro with his axe and slams twice with both arms. The second slam has a bit of range, so people at the back may get hit by this attack.

**Right back swing** – A full swing that will knock you back. Simply iframe.  

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Spin2Win** – He spin on his right hand while having his left hand out for a spinning attack. This attack is the circle – donut AoE attack, which you must move in or out to avoid it. 
* Cannot Block. Inflicts Bleed debuff
 

**Kamehameha** – He will select a random target. As the name implies, he charges up for an attack that will blow away anyone within the straight line in front of him. 
* It pushes you back, so try not to make him aim this attack toward the destroyed pylons which has a puddle.
* Cannot Block
 

**Sonic spin** – He looks over his shoulder similar to how he’d initiate his backswing, but instead he will curl a bit and jump for a sonic spin like the first boss. 
* This is deadly for people at the back, not so much for the person in front (hopefully this is a tank).
* Inflicts Bleed debuff
 

**Fall** – With quote : 

     “Fall before me!”

He will select one random target which he will focus on until he delivers a large cone AoE toward the target, then his behind.
* Cannot Block. Moderate damage. This will also inflict Stun on top of the damage.
