<h3>First Boss: Pepero</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Protect the Kegs!** - Throughout the fight, mobs will spawn:

     “Suicide Soldiers are targeting the X! 
     Break an oak barrel and use Inferno Spores to take them out“

Players will have to **prevent these mobs from destroying** the different Piles (Wine Barrels, Bomb Piles, Gunpowder Boxes, or Oil Barrels) in each corner of the arena. If any Pile is destroyed a message appears:

     “An explosion has damaged the ship!”

* The mobs cannot be CC-d by the player.
* If all of the Piles are destroyed, the party wipes.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Inferno Spores** - There will be barrels that spawn on the edges of the room. 
  * Breaking these will give nearby party members Inferno Spores, which deals flat damage every second to enemy monsters around the player. 
* Players should use this to defeat the monsters that spawn to protect the barrel kegs.
  * These spores damage friendly players as well.

**Ground Pound** - Pepero will raise his arms, shout :
     
     “Get back!”
     
Before pounding the ground multiple times, dealing frontal damage.
* Pepero will leave damaging AoE puddles on the ground. These AoE puddles deal damage per tick.

**Pushback** - Pepero will glow red, and unleash a frontal shockwave. His next attack directed towards his side and will players back.

**Shockwave** - Pepero will go into the center of the room and proceed to unleash frontal shockwaves four times in a counter-clockwise fashion. Each one of these will deal flat damage and is not blockable.
* After 50% HP, Pepero will have a different shockwave attack pattern.

<h3>Second Boss: </h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Overload!** - You’ll notice a bar. It will start at 0/100. 
* The more bomb monsters there are on the field, the higher the bar fills. 
  * Once the bar reaches 100, all bombs will explode and Polyphemus will rapidly fire lasers.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Bombs** - Stationary bomb monsters will occasionally spawn. These will activate once a player or the boss steps onto the area, stunning players and/or the boss.

**Hop** - Polyphemus will jump upwards before landing, dealing damage to nearby players.

**Laser** - Polyphemus will fire a laser towards a random target that will deal damage and leave the ground scorched, dealing damage to players standing in the area.

**Ripples** - Polyphemus will stomp on the ground, creating three earthquakes with expanding size.

**Leap** - Happens when Polyphemus says : 

     “Polyphemus is targeting (Player)
     Lure him to the bomb squad!” 
     
* Polyphemus will begin charging a powerful attack. After a few seconds, Polyphemus will jump towards that player. 
  * The player should aim to move so that Polyphemus will land onto a bomb so he can be stunned. **He will then proceed to do Earthquake.**

**Earthquake** - If Polyphemus is not stunned by a bomb after Leaping, he will unleash two waves of damage (iframeable) across the entire arena, dealing flat damage.
* Polyphemus does not announce who he is targeting (although there is still the secondary aggro purple circle).
* The waves will deal high damage, which has a much higher probability of killing players who failed to dodge.

**Petrification** - Polyphemus will target a random player and fire a large conal attack that deals heavy damage and leave a debuff that will petrify a player after a few seconds if not cleansed.

**Bomb Sparks** - Players are warned by :
 
     “Look Out!“
     
* After a few seconds a number of players will receive a large orange circle. After a few seconds, they will be knocked up for a long period of time.

<h3>Last Boss: Kalivan</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Flooding** - Throughout the fight, quarters of the arena will be flooded in water. The water doesn’t deal damage by itself, though **if you are electrified with Electricity Overload, you will take damage.**
* Water lanes will flood more often as the fight goes on.

### **Electricity Overload** 
- Certain attacks will **apply Electricity Overload on players for 45 seconds**. 
  - If players step into Flooded areas while they have Electricity Overload, any player in the area takes damage. Electricity Overload will stack up to five times. 
  - Getting two stacks of Electricity Overload will apply Electric Shock Overload, which is a damage over time debuff that can be cleansed. 
  - Getting five stacks of Electricity Overload will stun the player.

**Electricity Bomb** - Kalivan will throw a projectile at players at a distance. Players hit by this will receive damage and **Electricity Overload**.

**Mini Lightning Bolts** - Kalivan will shout : 

     “Behold my thunderous wrath!” 

Before placing circles on all players. 
* After a duration, the circles will solidify and players have a short period to escape before the circles explode, dealing damage and applying Electricity Overload to players who failed to escape. 
* He will proceed to do Big Lightning Bolt immediately after.

**Big Lightning Bolt** -  Message of :  

     “(Player) is targeted by Big Lightning Bolt”
     
* Is announced and a random player is targeted for an attack.
  * The player will be stunned and will be struck with heavy damage in 6 seconds. 
* Party members should stay inside the target circle in order to split the damage taken.
* If taken solo, will deals very high damage to a single player. Mystic thralls, Gunner ST-4 and Warrior shadows count as extra bodies to help split the damage. 
  * If no player is inside (or if all players inside die) when the Lightning strikes, Kalivan will proceed to do Lightning Storm.
