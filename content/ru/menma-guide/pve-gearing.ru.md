* For **Dark Light** & **Annihilation** gear you should do dungeons such as Red Refuge & RK9, there you will get gear boxes <br>
(The gear options always random)
* **Best you can get:** 4x random roll on weapon <br>
(In addition to have double CRD) <br>
  
      Except healers, their max rolls are 3x

## How to get Kaia / Mythic Gear

**Mythic gear, also referred to as Kaia gear, is an available upgrade for gold Exodor gear.**
You keep the random lines on your source gear, you had any, and enchantment costs and rates remain the same after conversion. <br>
You can upgrade a +0 to a +15 piece of gold gear to Kaia / Mythic at any time once you've unlocked the upgrade option.

1. Go the the Kaiator Command center. You'll have quest prompts on how to get there if you've never been before.
2. Smash 'F' on some NPCs then you'll need to clear 2 dungeons to get quest materials.
3. Clear **Broken Prison**.
4. Go back to Kaiator Command, smash 'f' on NPCs again then you'll do the same at Muhrak's Workshop in Habere.
5. After talking with Kaia and Fovarth, you'll need to clear Gossamer's Vault (HARD) for another quest material.
6. Clear **Gossamer's Vault (HARD)** once.
7. Go back to Muhrak's Workshop and finish the quest. You'll get a token Black Shard and Nodule for your effort.
8. You can now use Kaia's Anvil to upgrade to Kaia / mythic whenever you have the required materials.
