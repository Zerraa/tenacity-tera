In Kumas Royale, all players are transformed into kumases and battle it out for victory over three rounds.

**The aim is to eliminate the enemy team's boss; manage that and you win the round.** The team which wins two rounds claims victory on the battleground and will receive additional reputation!

At the start of the round, each player starts off as a Baby Kumas. Once the round starts, after a short waiting period, one player in the group can become the Kumas Boss by talking to him with the ‘F’ key.

Baby and boss kumases have different skill sets.

At certain intervals, a Pallialith will appear in each sandpit which regenerates HP. <br>
**If a baby kumas destroys this crystal, they'll receive an effect which allows them to heal themselves and other nearby kumases.**
- Kumas bosses cannot reach the Pallialith. 
  - In order to protect and heal the boss, a baby kumas must first destroy the Pallialith and then move within range of their boss.

Each round lasts a maximum of 5 minutes. If neither boss has been defeated after this time, the team whose boss has the most HP wins the round. <br>
If both bosses have the same HP, then the round is drawn.
