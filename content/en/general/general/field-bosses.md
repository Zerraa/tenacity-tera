### Lag Issues

Similar to Nexus or Dreamstorm, large number of players concentrated in a small area exposed the 32bit client's inability to handle the overload of network packets and graphically rendering actions of over a hundred players, leading to client freezing until the surge of information decreased or disconnecting from the server. <br>
Several screenshots posted by TERA KR players showed more than half of the participating raid members disconnected from the server due to lag issues. <br>
As a result without being able to solve the issue, Field Boss Monster content on Exodor Archipelago was removed.

### Spawn Rates

Field Boss Monsters Ortan, Hazard, and Cerrus can spawn between **4hr 30min** to **5hr 30min** from their death.
