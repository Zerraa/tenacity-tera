Time is written in CEST.

<hr/>

The event is announced thirty minutes before the first monsters are summoned (e.g. at 7:30 PM).<br>
Ten minutes before the start (e.g. at 7:50 PM), the various locations will appear on the map, after which time the quests can be accepted.<br>
**The first enemies will then appear on the hour (e.g. at 8 PM).**

Open the world map and take a closer look at the region Val Oriyn. In the top-left of the map there is now a button which allows you to display the position of the seven Oneiric Generators as well as show the general status of the invasion at any given time.

Whether alone or in a group, select the location you'd like to defend and teleport over there with a click of the mouse on the relevant point on the map.

## Start of the event

</center>

Once the 10-minute preparation phase is over, the first enemies will appear. The run of play is disarmingly simple:

- For each Oneiric Generator there are 4 additional devices which must also be protected. Over the course of 10 minutes, increasingly difficult enemies appear and will try to destroy these devices.
- The longer the defense of the 4 devices and generator goes on, the stronger the enemies that appear.
- The players are victorious as long as the generator survives; the monsters win if the generator is destroyed within the first 10 minutes.

During the battle, the mini-map converts into a kind of overview, replacing the regular map with indicators showing the hit points of the **5 structures**, the remaining defense time, the position of the monsters, and which device is currently being attacked.
