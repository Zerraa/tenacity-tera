A crit cap or crit-factor cap is the point at which having any more crit factor is a detriment to your DPS potential.

#### What Factors Influence the Crit Cap?
- Boss Level versus Your Level 
  - The difference between the target and your level will adjust how much crit factor is needed for your skills to crit.<br>
  It might be an impact on how much crit resist the boss has but the important part is the higher you are relative to the target, the lower amount of crit factor you need.
- Healer and Boss and You
  - The healer in your party can debuff the boss and buff you. The boss debuff is a reduction in their crit resist, but only if the healer has that talent maxed out. <br>
  This is the same for both priest and mystic. The buff on you is a crit factor increase and is only caused by the mystic Aura of the Merciless. This is generally conveyed as a +60 crit factor difference. 
  - This is why the crit cap with a priest party is higher than with a mystic party.
- You and Your Own Skills
  - Depending on your class, you will have skills, glyphs, and talents that will impact your own crit factor. For example, being in **Assault Stance** as a warrior will increase your Crit Factor. 
  - The crit cap for your class is probably assuming that you are using your class specific buffs, but you need to check whether or not the buff is taken into consideration.

#### Archer
</center>

You can universally run a full power set with full pumped etchings and double golden V relics without having to worry much about your crit rate.

<hr/>

<center>

#### Berserker
</center>

You will be fine with around 300 crit factor, rest power.

<hr/>

#### Brawler
</center>

Full power, dont even bother.

<hr/>

<center>

#### Gunner
</center>

Go full power jewelery, for priest use double golden V relics. For mystic, use golden halidom and blue power relic.

<hr/>

<center>

#### Lancer
</center>

Depending on your healer, you are fine with 280 crit with mystic; 300-320 for priest.

<hr/>

<center>

#### Ninja
</center>

Around ~270-300 total crit factor you should be good to run any dungeon.

<hr/>

<center>

#### Reaper
</center>

With around ~250-280 total crit factor you should be good to run any dungeon.

<hr/>

<center>

#### Slayer
</center>

Depending on bosses, your crit will most likely change, but with priest you should be fine with 450 crit; with mystic you should be fine with 400 crit.

<hr/>

<center>

#### Sorcerer
</center>

On 278 minimum, up to 304 in combat; assuming power food :
- 143-169 mystic 
- 185-211 with priest
Recommend around 210 with priest to be cosy.

Gold relidoms beat blue relidoms even if you are overcrit until you are at least 343 in combat (250 profile with priest - then its about equal - if you swap blue halidom for gold halidom). <br>
Break even point for gold relic -> blue relic is 447 in combat (354 profile with priest - too high for you to ever realistically get to.

#### Valkyrie
</center>

Once you get into level 70, and get your exodor gear (anni/kaia) and max skill advancement you'll have near 120 (58+61) crit factor and that's all you need.

<hr/>

#### Warrior
</center>

**DPS**

At just 126 total crit factor (52+74), a Castanic Warrior DPS with the triple crit chance glyph will already hit the crit cap on Scythe in AQ, for non-castanic Warriors, this number is 133 (52+81). This is so low that even with the worst of gear, you can't reach it. <br>
- Blade Waltz-and Deadly Gamble-boosted Rain of Blows and Blade Draw cap out to 100% at 218 (52+166) and 225 (52+173) total crit factor respectively.

- These numbers are even lower on bosses below your level and lower crit resistances than AQ, and don't even account for crit resist debuffs like Azart Mark or Priest/Mystic's talents.
- Knowing this makes jewelry-and jewelry-etching choices trivial, just go full power.

**TANK**

The scythe crit cap for tanks in AQ is at 213 (52+161) total crit factor. Go for at least +160 (212 total) crit factor.
