Gathering is a game feature in TERA which allows a character to gather materials from various materials across Arborea and Exodor which can be used in crafting.

<hr/>

There are three types of gathering professions: 
1. Ore gathering
2. Essence gathering
3. Plant gathering. <br>

All three gathering professions are automatically learned upon character creation, and start off at level 1 with 0 points. There are 6 levels of gathering and a **total of 350 gathering points** to be earned. <br>
Level 1 requires 100 points to advance to level 2, but from then on leveling requires only 50 points. <br>

An indicator of the level of gathering skill can be found in the **Gathering tab** of the Character Profile. When you get each of the three gathering skill to level 300 you will gain a row of **8 Inventory Expansion slots**.

Every node you gather will *increase your respective gathering skill by 3 points*. <br>
Gathering a node **costs 10 production points(10 PP)** and will give you **3-5 of the respective item** for that node, with a possible bonus 1-4 of a different material, if applicable. <br>
There is a small chance of receiving a high number of material, **between 10-14 material**. There is *no chance to fail* when gathering. <br>
Gathering of nodes is not restricted by your gathering level. Gathering speed is, however, affected by a players gathering level.

### Plant Harvest

Materials gathered from plants are used in Etching and Cooking. <br>
There are **14 achievements** to be earned from plant harvesting. There are six different plants for you to harvest across the world.
