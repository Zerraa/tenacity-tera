<hr/>

All Players start in front of the last boss Banyakas. But there are the other two bosses in the back in the original teleport location. <br><br>
If you want to complete the instance the old way, you can go protect both of the bosses before finally arriving to Banyaka.<br>
When you fight Banyaka, there you have to destroy a **red crystal** before attacking Banyaka directly. Reward chest will spawn after fight is finished.

The First boss mission is to protect guardian from attacking mobs until all crystals where mobs spawn break. <br> 
Second boss encounter is to defend second guardian while he recovers. You must attack two teraliths to stun them or draw aggro so they won't hit guardian. 

If you choose to skip the two guardians they get possessed and spawn on sides of Banyaka to do random **stun attacks** (red rings) during boss fight. Also boss fight gets harder and you have to damage boss himself to bring him down to around 30%.

### Mechanics

</center>

Throughout the fight, he’ll spawn Ghilliedhus which will attack you. They have relatively low health and drop motes which heal and regenerate your MP. <br> These Ghilliedhus can be knocked down and stunned.

**Lateral Shockwave** - Depending on which side you’re on, Banyakas will send a wave of damage on one half of the field.<br>
This is easy to notice and dodge as it’s a slow attack, pay attention to his hands.

**Heavy Blow** - You’ll receive a warning message :

     “There will be nothing left of you but ash!” 
     
Banyakas will slam his hands on the ground on the left and right side, if you stand near you’ll receive quite a lot of damage.
* You can easily avoid this mechanic by staying in the middle section. 
* The area of damage is not big and you’ll find yourself not worrying about this mechanic as much. 
  * He’ll then proceed to do **Frontal Fire**

**Frontal Fire** - Banyakas will exert fire in front of him towards Dominolith Shard and the bridge. Dealing damage in that area. 
* This is a fixed position and he can only exert fire down the middle of the field.

**Bitter Fruits** - You’ll receive a warning message :

     “I bear the most bitter fruit!“
    
The field will be split with a red zone and a safe zone. You must get away from Banyakas by heading to the safe outer section of the field as it’s a close range attack. 
* You’ll receive multiple damage and a slowing debuff if hit.

**Fiery Breath** - You’ll receive a warning message: 

     “I’ll burn you to ash!“
     
The field will be split with a red zone and a safe zone. You must get close to Banyakas by heading to the safe inner section of the field as it’s a long range attack. 
* You’ll receive multiple damage and a slowing debuff if hit.

### Tips

</center>

- During boss fight some ghilliedhus mobs spawn. Kill those to get **health motes**.
- On last boss the red crystal has its backside outside, towards player.

When fight is over it's recommended to exit dungeon with command **/reset**. That resets dungeon and bosses to allow second run. <br>
Fastest way to do two runs is to use scroll again inside dungeon, which teleports you back to Velik, after that do **/reset** before entering dungeon again. *This avoids loading Velika city models.*
