## Reputation levels and points

</center>

Reputation is very similar to experience. 

Reputation is divided into a number of **different levels** for which players must earn reputation points to progress through. *Higher reputation levels generally require more points* than the previous level to progress. Reputation points, just like experience points, are gained through quests and killing various mobs.

Various quests and faction-specific rewards are available across the levels, but the **player must be able to interact with the faction NPCs** to gain access to these rewards. **This usually requires Favorable​​​ or better standing.**

|   **Level**  	| **Points to levelup** 	|                   **Notes**                   	|

## Gaining reputation

</center>

You get reputation by completing non-repeatable quests will usually increase your reputation with the quest giver's faction(s) by a fixed number of points. Most of the factions also have special daily quests that give reputation when completed, or special mobs that give reputation when killed.

For higher-end factions, a general strategy exists to make a reputation **grind** as painless as possible. **Take the Valsekyr Hunt for example.** There are several ways in which to earn reputation for them: doing standard quests, killing mobs in and around Argonea and Granarkus, killing BAMs, and **doing daily quests**.
