Naslow maps are a random drop from dungeons that allow you and up to a party of five people to go to a location and get some loot. The maps have a duration of 3 hours from the time of their pickup so you should keep an eye on your inventory for maps. <br> 
They cannot be traded but they can be stored in a guild bank and other people with guild bank access can take them out.


### How to use them?

Naslow maps are greyed out / inactive until you are in the correct location for their use. <br>
There are five Naslow maps. Naslow's Treasure Map **[Archive Grounds]**, Naslow's Treasure Map **[Aurum Road]**, Naslow's Treasure Map **[Citadel of Torment]**, Naslow's Treasure Map **[Quarantine Zone]**, Naslow's Treasure Map **[Thrallhold]**.

The detail texts on the map will tell you where to go. <br>
1. "Use this map under three trees on the road where **Tulufan** and **Cathedral Passageway** meet. A friend will show you the way."
2. "Use this map in the hidden cave connecting **Quarantine Zone** and **Northern Feral Valley**. A friend will show you the way."
3. "Use this map at the location where **Lok's Spear** is. A friend will show you the way."
4. "Use this map at the place which you must pass to get to the **Citadel of Torment**'s basementâ€”a frozen room where the Wraith statues and books are located. A friend will show you the way."
5. "Use this map beneath **Field Base Reciprocity**, inside the cave the stairways are pointing at, where an alien pipe is located. A friend will show you the way."

### Loot

There are three tiers of loot that you can get from a Naslow map. <br>
A Hidden Gold Crate, Hidden Silver Crate, and Hidden Wooden Crate. The odds of getting each tier isn't too bad, compared to other loot in TERA. Generally, you'll get:

- Some gems
- Might get old plates (gold and silver)
- Old infusion material tokens
- Harmonious Imbalance design
- Harmonious Imbalance items
- Titan's items, used for Etching crafting, but generally useless. Feed them to your pets!

And the higher tier boxes will have more than the lower ones. The main point of doing Naslow Maps now are for the gems to sell and for the achievement for activating all five maps.
