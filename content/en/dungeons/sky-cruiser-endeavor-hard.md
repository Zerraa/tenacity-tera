Perimos will be firing lasers at random players, notified by <br>

     “Perimos is gathering power for an attack!”
     
This does not follow players and is indicated by the purple secondary aggro circle. The tank should tank the mobs near Perimos, to make dodging lasers easier.

<h3>First Boss: Putrion</h3>

The tank should attempt to position the boss far from the gate, as certain attacks may cause Putrion to charge through the gate and reset.

     Menma's TERA changes:

     - He is quicker.
     - Can still be knocked up / bullrushed.
     - Mobs (archers and hulks) hurt a LOT. Stun them and focus.

  * This can be cleansed. **If stunned, Putrion will focus his next attack on you.**

**Stun** - Putrion will reveal a large red circle around him, indicating his next attack.

<h3>Second Boss: Perimos</h3>

All players should attempt to stay in the middle of the room, to avoid the boss moving around too far for certain mechanics.

     Menma's TERA changes:

     - Crystals have 200k HP
     - Lasers have been buffed.
       - They deal 960k total damage. 
       - 5 people MUST GATHER or it will break the crystal.
     - When a crystal gets destroyed he gains a 400M shield. 

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Aeonalis Pylons** - A message will be announced saying: 

     “Perimos is trying to destroy an aeonalis pylon!”
     
Perimos will move to the center of the room and focus one of the stones located on the outer edge of the room. 
* There are 8 in total, the boss will attempt to destroy these stones with a laser. You and your party must stand inside the lasers range to decrease the damage these pylons receive.
  * You will receive damage and a DoT debuff; your healer must cleanse and heal the party. 
  * **If you fail to shield the stones and if all 8 break, your party will wipe.** This laser is a purple color and is not to be confused with the boss’s normal laser attack.

He’ll only do one purple laser at a time from 100% to 70% every 50 seconds. He’ll then proceed to do 2 consecutive purple lasers from 69% to 30% every 50 seconds. <br>
After 30%, Perimos will do two consecutive red lasers instead of one. The second one is aimed at the furthest player.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Laser** - Perimos will attempt to laser a player, indicated by the purple ring, you must avoid this deadly attack. **This laser is orange/yellow in color and is not to be confused with Aeonalis Pylons laser.**
* However, you should move out of the way of any Aeonalis Pylons (do not stand between the boss and a stone if the laser is on you) as this laser can also damage the stones. 
  * This occurs when Perimos says :
  
        “Small things.. So bothersome.. I’ll kill.. “
     
* You should iframe this laser as it cannot be blocked. 

**Blast Wave** - Perimos will use to inner energy to deal a wave of damage in a cone/arc formation. He’ll say :

     “Get back!”

**Dislocated Swipe** - Perimos will remove his arm and use it as a weapon. He’ll swipe it side to side four times whilst moving forward.

**Dislocated Slam** - Perimos will remove his arm and use it as a weapon. He’ll slam against the ground and then proceed to slam it further into the ground four times. 
* The third one can hit players directly behind him while the fourth one does significantly higher damage. 

**Web** - Perimos will crouch and spawn webs on the floor around him. These webs will damage and debuff players with a heavy movement speed decrease. 
* This can be cleansed.

**Central Slam** - If Perimos moves too far from the middle, he’ll slam his arm into the ground and jump towards the middle causing fatal damage to anyone near the middle. 
* Perimos will shout **“Pylons… So very fragile…”** and destroy a pylon with either a Dislocated Swipe or a Web.

<h3>Last Boss: Darkan</h3>

    - 1 Swipe is still iframable.
    - When he kneels down, he applies a bleed and a root.

    - At 25% he will put a 3minute bleeding debuff on every person.
      - Bleeds for 7% every 2 seconds. 
      - Bleeds way more when fully buffed at 10%.
    - Fire bleeding from his attacks is no longer cleansable.
      - Stacks up. 
    - His secondary aggro will most likely kill you, its very fast.

    - Ghosts have 2.5 bilion HP.
      - They hit for 150k
    - They MUST be stunned or you will have a bad time.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Rings of Fire** - Darkan will rise into the air and create a circle cage. You must enter, anyone out of this cage will die when Darkan lands. The cage will split into 3 sections, inner, mid and outer. 
  * One section will randomly become a danger zone (noticeable by red indicator), avoid this zone. 
* This occurs 3 times before Darkan slams the ground, breaking the cage and dealing fatal damage to players outside (cannot be iframed, although you can use non-standard iframes such as Breakaway Bolt to survive).
![](https://i.imgur.com/uePjY4V.png)

* **After the first Ghost phase, the rings will occur 4 times being Darkan slams the ground. In addition, 2 rings can be active at once.**
![](https://i.imgur.com/o8aMRsY.png)

**Darkan's Servants** - At 75% and 50% HP, Darkan will say : 

     “The fire will consume you!“
     
Then disappear and the room will turn red. **A ghost will spawn**, choose the player with the highest aggro, say :

     “(Player), you’ll die…” 
  
And proceed to chase and attack him/her with static damage until player dies. Once it spawns, healers should use a heal to generate aggro and proceed to kite the ghost. 
* **If you do not kill it within the time limit, the party will take fatal damage and die.**
  * The 50% Minion phase will have 2 Minion’s instead of 1.

**Fire Wing** - This mechanic is important to master. Darkan will slam the ground with his swords often. 
* If Darkan sword slams (his regular auto attack) with his Left sword (rear view), he will continue to slam the ground another 2 times then he will proceed with the Fire Wing.
![](https://i.imgur.com/vTWgdu6.gif)

* This mechanic will push you the edge of the map and applies **fire bleeding** effect. 
* To avoid getting hit you must pay attention to his swords. The 4th/final slam onto the ground determines the direction of the Fire Wing. 
  * Darkan can fire left or right and the direction is determined by which sword (left or right) is used for the **4th slam**.

<br>

1. If the left sword is fiery and against the ground (and the right sword in the air), then he will use his right wing and proceed the attack in the right direction.
2. If the right sword is fiery and against the ground (and the left sword in the air), then he will use his left wing and proceed the attack in the left direction.

**Dodge This!** - He will also do 3 consecutive Fire Wing without doing 4 consecutive slams. Each Wing is individual and may be left or right so it is important to pay attention to his swords. 
* Darkan will say **“I!”** and proceed the first Fire Wing, then **“Will!”** and do the second, then finally **“Obliterate you!”** and then do the third.

**Enraged Darkan** - Once Darkan passes **25% HP**, he will shout : 

     “I’ll show you true power!”
     
He will enrage and deal more damage. This begins a three minute timer. Once the time limit passes, your party will wipe. 
* During this period, he will be limited to only Basic Combos, Fire Wings, secondary aggro Empowered Strikes, and Sword Throws.

**Fire zone** - At 94%, a fiery area will appear on the left and right of the room. At 54% and 25%, this area grows larger. Moving or getting pushed into these areas will instantly kill players. 
* These players cannot be revived with a Priest or Mystic Resurrection, but they can use a Goddess’s Blessing to walk out safely.

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

Darkan will repeatedly use these combos throughout the fight:
**Fire Wing Turn** - If Darkan attacks with his **left sword (rear view/DPS view) first**, he will proceed 2 consecutive normal attacks and then a Fire Wing. 

**Fire Swipe** - If Darkan attacks with his **right sword (rear view/DPS view) first**, he will proceed with doing a normal attack with his left sword, do a Fire Swipe backwards, then do a Empowered Strike

**Fire Charge** - If Darkan attacks with **2 consecutive Empowered Strikes**, he will proceed with 2 Fire Swipe backwards and then a Fire Charge forwards.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

### Empowered Darkan

**Fire Bleeding** - Certain attacks will apply a debuff that ticks for a percentage of a player’s maximum HP. 
* This debuff cannot be cleansed.

![](https://i.imgur.com/2FB1vs2.png)

**Fire Slam** - Darkan will twirl into the air, your party must get at least 18m away from Darkan as he will proceed to slam the ground, causing fatal damage up to 18m.
* Darkan can cast this multiple times in a row, and he will usually precede this with a Backstep.

**Fire Circles** - Darkan will sheath his swords and rise into the air. 
* Your party should run to the edges as Darkan will place DoT circles on each player. You should attempt to avoid being hit by escaping just before the circles take root to avoid damage.

**Fire Charge** - Darkan will spin and charge towards a player, causing damage. You will not be pushed. This is always used after a double Fire Swipe.

**Sword Throw(Ressbait)** - The boss will throw his swords and pull them back, leaving the ground scorched for a few seconds.
* If a healer casts Resurrect, Darkan will shout : 

      “Your time is running out!” 
    
And throw his swords at the healer.

**Scream** - Darkan will throw his swords into the ground and scream, applying a cleanseable debuff that deals damage over time and silences players. 
* This can be blocked, although the attack will still deal damage. Healers can cast their cleanse right before the silence is applied to cleanse party members immediately.

**Empowered Strike** - Darkan will empower his weapon, slam the ground, and then strike with enormous power, dealing massive damage and applying the fire bleeding debuff.
