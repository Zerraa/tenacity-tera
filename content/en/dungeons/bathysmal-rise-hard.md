<h3>First Boss: Mephisis</h3>

- The tank should aggro the boss towards the rock near the exit of the platform. You will be pushed a lot.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Poisonous Gas** -  At **80% HP**, you will receive a warning

     “The air’s too fresh. Let’s fix that!”
     
That means the rocks will shatter in set timed interval.There are 2 rocks, **on either side of the northern wall**.
* The second one will be announced by “There’s no antidote for my fury!” and will occur at **60% HP**. 
*  The poison wave will activate faster and there is not enough time to close the rock once it shatters, but you can still close the rock again. Healers should be prepared to cleanse the poison when it happens.

* Failing to block the hole (by interacting within 8 seconds of shattering) will result in the field being covered in a wave of poison every 30 seconds. 
  * If hit by the poison, your screen will be distorted and you will receive a 10 second poison. 
* You must jump to remove the distortion and be cleansed by a healer to remove the poison. 
* **The rock shatters again, every 1 minute and 10 seconds.** (Warning Message: “The rocks scatter again.“)

**Chelonian Armor** - At 30% HP, the turtle will hide in its shell and begin to glow white, you must DPS heavily to burn the shield. Failure to do so will cause Mephisis to deal a devastating AoE pool hitting everyone on the field. 
* This could potentially lead to a party wipe.
  * **Poisonous Breath** - Mephisis will spit poison towards a player. If hit, you’ll receive damage and a poison debuff (draining 8% HP per second). 
    * This can be cleansed.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Puddle of Poison** - Mephisis will target one random player with a stationary red circle (doesn’t follow you), you have 3 seconds to escape the circle otherwise you will receive damage. 
* This mechanic happens when you first engage and throughout the battle.

**Powerful Groundpower** - Mephisis will head slam the ground twice, these head slams cause knockback. 
* The first two slams will be AoE slams in front of the boss (Tank Slams) and the third will be an AoE slam around the boss (Tank, DPS and Healer Slam).
![](https://i.imgur.com/3SFXAOK.jpg)

**Ring of Death** - Mephisis tucks into his shell and begins to spray poison in an AoE pool shaped ring around him. You can either stay close, or afar to avoid damage. 
* If hit, you will also be Poisoned (cleanse-able).
![](https://i.imgur.com/VCxh7pN.jpg)

**Spinning Claw Attack** -  Mephisis tucks into his shell, hiding briefly. It will then begin to spin and move, causing damage to those who get hit. 
* This mechanic is block-able.

**Bathysmal Kamaras** - Mephisis will begin to glow blue, say :

     “It’s kamaras all the way down!“
     
* And then summon six mini-turtles. **You must knockdown the boss**, if you fail to do so, you will have to take on the mini-turtles as well.
![](https://i.imgur.com/oC5ux7N.jpg)

**Body Slam** - Mephisis’s eyes will glow red and tiptoe twice. Then it will body slam dealing colossal damage in an AoE form.
* You must either block or back away to avoid damage.

<h3>Second Boss: Tantibus</h3>

- The tank should take advantages of the corners (you may need to reposition yourself into a different corner) of the room. 
  - Try to wedge yourself to avoid being pushed around. This boss tends to move around a lot.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Primal Fear** - The boss will begin to glow blue, say :

     “Can you control your fear? I doubt it!” 
     
This means you have **7 seconds to stagger or knockdown** the boss. Failure to do this will cause it to do a flip and fear everyone for 10 seconds when it slams. 
*This is cleanse-able. 
  * Tantibus is hard to stagger or knockdown, and the debuff cannot be iframed.

**Water Wall** - A message 

     “Clean water fills the pool”
     
Will notify your group that a barrier is surrounding the pool in the center of the room. 
**You will need to DPS this barrier if you want to access the pool to be cleansed from the Phenric Slime.**

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Phenric Slime** - Tantibus will target one player randomly with a red circle (this circle follows you). After a few seconds, it’ll be placed on the ground and will stay. If you step in the circle, you will receive a debuff which drains your MP and prevents you from gaining MP from any source. 
* This cannot be cleansed by a healer, you must run to the pool in the center of the room to be cleansed. 
* You will know that you will be targeted as you will gain the purple ring.

**Don’t Look Into The Light!** - The boss will randomly target a player and pull them towards the boss. It will then throw a Phenric Slime on them, causing the Phenric Slime to be where the boss is. 
* The tank would have to move the boss. 
* You can iframe the chain.

**Looping** - The boss will suck up any nearby players, bringing them underneath it and then slam on top of them dealing damage. 
* You can iframe both the pull and slam.

**Crossed Waves** - During the fight, the pool will overflow. The room will split into danger and safe zones. 
* If hit, you will be flung to the edge of the map and receive flat damage.
  * Danger zones are highlighted with a purple, watery effect.

<h3>Last Boss: </h3>

- The tank should aim to allow the bosses back be exposed without making the DPS to DPS against the wall and leave them vulnerable. 
  - You may want to tank the boss in a circle around the arena to avoid being walled as much. 
  - Walling is fine, however the tank may be pushed to the side causing the DPS to be against the wall if they want to backcrit.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Floodwaters** - At **85%, 55%, and 25%,** the boss will disappear and you will be notified with the message:

     “Water rushes into the chamber.” 
     
* Your party must relocate themselves to the inner circle of the field. You will be tossed to the edge of the field when the water reaches the inner circle. 
  * The pushback cannot be iframed and it will apply a cleanseable debuff that will damage players for a percentage of their maximum health per second. 
  * The party should gather up so they all face the same wall so the healer can cleanse the party easier.

**Fulmisphere** - The boss will summon spheres, which he throws at players. There will be 3 of them, they do not do a lot of damage, so you can stack them to avoid having them all over the map.
* However if you feel they become a pain, you can kill them. They begin to do regular attacks when the message **“These might sting a bit“** pops up.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ia9hEFQ.png)

**Lightning Shield** - Fulminar will get a blue aura, start walking towards the person with primary aggro, and then swipe his blade dealing massive damage. You’ll then receive the message: 

     “Fulminar gathers power for a massive attack!”

And Fulminar will receive a shield. Failing to destroy the shield will result in damage and being flung to the edges of the field. 
* Success will result in the boss being stunned for a few seconds.
* Failing to destroy the shield and to iframe will also apply a cleanse-able debuff that ticks for a percentage of a players maximum health.

**Gift of Annihilation (Part 1)** - You will be notified, as the boss will warn your party with: 

     “I bring you the gift of annihilation.”

* You will need to get inside the circle cage quickly. If you are outside when the cage has been formed, you will get one-shot.
  * The boss will then carry out part 2 of this mechanic.
* Theres a new pattern that has six unsafe triangles and six safe triangles that alternate with each other, with the area directly in front of Fulminar being an unsafe zone. 
* The person with the primary aggro circle (usually the tank) should move 90 degrees in either direction during Part 1 to see whether Fulminar will turn.

**Gift of Annihilation (Part 2)** - The boss will spin and the floor inside the cage will split into different zones. These zones will alternate between red (unsafe) and non-red (safe) zones. 
* Avoid the red circle patterns to avoid being killed. It’ll then jump up in the air and crash down with a Bounce; breaking the cage.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Buzz Mode** - At **90%, 60%, and 30%,** a message will appear :

     “Let’s speed up this dance!“

And the boss will disappear to summon its clones from the corners of the room. 
* They transform and move in a straight-line shown with a red line. **Avoid the lines as this is a 1-shot mechanic.**
  * Every Buzz Mode occurrence will have its own pattern and the last two cutters will leave DOT lines dealing damage rapidly.

**Massive Chainsaw** - The boss slams the ground with his razor, causing an AoE zone. Players who are on the outer edge of this zone will be drawn towards the center; those who were impacted receive the debuff Electric Nimbus. 
* This debuff creates an AoE circle around you (which grows) damaging your teammates if they step inside. 
  * Cannot be cleansed.

**Bounce** - The boss jumps in the air and then smashes the ground on landing. 
* Creating an electrical wave, it damages players and causes a knock back.

**Shock Wave** - Turns around and launches a shock wave. This will push you slightly. Cannot be blocked.

**Shock Ring** - Forms a ring of electrical damage, players must be close or far away to avoid damage.
* Not to be confused with Gift of Annihilation rings. This is just a ring around the boss and will only deal damage in a static zone.
