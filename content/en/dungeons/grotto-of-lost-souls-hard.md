<h3>First Boss: Nedra</h3>

* The room and yourself will be surrounded in either Purple or Green auras. Periodically flowers will drop down from the sky; we’ll talk more about this in Key Mechanics. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/N0MEWlJ.png)
* Understand that getting hit by the flower explosion will swap your debuff. After all flowers are done dropping, you need to have an aura that matches with the color of the room.
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Flowers** - A text message saying :

     “A Strange Odor Fills the Air” 
     
* Will show up and the **outer area of the map will start glowing Purple or Green**. 
* The entire party will also get a debuff which gives you a Purple or Green aura as well.
![](https://i.imgur.com/XZ8Ik4K.png)

* The room and yourself will have these auras until the :

      “Aren’t You Pretty?”
     
**Text message appears**, which indicates that the boss will go underground and flowers start falling to the ground.
* During this mechanic, you **must make your aura match the color of the room. These flowers explode as they hit the ground and can be iframed but you don’t always want to iframe them.
 
![](https://i.imgur.com/zwIper4.png)

* **Getting hit by an explosion will switch the debuff you have**; 
  
     Green will become Purple and vice-versa. 
     To dodge an explosion, you must iframe. 
     Either 1 or 2 flowers will fall.

**Two flowers**

**Big Bite** - Double hit in the front, shares animation with Fart – difference being in mouth starting to glow.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Who wants to feed me?** - The boss will go underground with the message 

     Who wants to feed me?

And does an AoE attack near the one with secondary aggro. This AoE stuns, and if anyone gets stunned, the boss eats him, killing him. Get away from the initial position of secondary aggro or iframe.

**Thorn Hell** - Boss does an AoE and then goes underground, releasing thorn balls in a specific circular pattern. 
* Getting hit by the AoE will put a cleansable & slowing debuff on you. Thorns cause bleed on hit. **Walk around or iframe through them.**

  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/w7kT0sE.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Thorn Wall** - The boss quickly does two series of 2 bites then follows with an attack that spawns Thorn Walls on target(s) far away. **Spawns one in Normal Mode and two in Hard Mode.**
* A small purple ring will appear under your feet if you are about to be targeted. These walls last around 1 to 2 seconds. 
  * End of animation is identical to Plant Boom. 
  * Standing in it does no damage, but **moving or iframing into the walls will stun you**.

**Impaler** - The claws of the boss start glowing and he will throw an **iframeableAoE attack at the secondary aggro** target. Will knock up if you get hit. Ress bait in Hard Mode.

**Rock ‘n Roll** - Rocks fall from the sky and roll from the front of the boss to behind the boss, then the boss rolls backwards. **Can be iframed or facetanked.**
* The dirt animation will alert you to whether large or small rocks will fall. Large rocks have a larger amount & area of dirt falling. Hard to see in the videos.

<h3>Second Boss: Ptakum</h3>

* In this room there are 3 statues. 
* They’re purpose will be explained in Key Mechanics, however do take note that every statue slowly releases an expanding AoE that puts a debuff on the first target it hits. This includes the boss.

**Statue lasers** - The statues are the most important part of this boss fight. There are 3 statues in this room – their names are Bloody (Red), Radiant (White), and Cursed (Purple).
* Each one of them produces a wave that puts their debuff on the first target it hits. The goal is to get all 3 of the debuffs on the boss. To do this, don’t get hit by the statue’s wave. 
  * You cannot iframe through this wave, you must run from it. 
* **Depending on how many debuffs are on boss / players, he will do different attacks during this mechanic:**
  * **All 3 on boss:** the boss will be stunned for a short duration.
  * **0-1 on players:** 30% HP damage to everyone and applying 1 bleed stack + powerup buff on boss
  * **2 on players:** 50% HP damage to everyone and applying 2 bleed stacks + powerup buff on boss
  * **3 on players:** 100% HP damage to everyone. This ignores shield so it’s just a wipe.

**Statues can be destroyed with the Break Wave attack.This also degrades the mechanic to a lower tier and a wipe can be avoided.**

* In Hard Mode he will do 2 statues at same time below 50% like so:

**In/Out** - After the In or Out attack he will do either a large AoE around him or a small AoE on all players.
* **These need to be iframed.**

**Boss will be visibly winding up for a spin in the Outer AoE clip, while he does not wind up for the Inner AoE.**
* Getting hit by the second attack of the inner AoE will pushback. Getting hit by the second attack of the Outer AoE will throw you in the air and toss you.

<h3>Last Boss: Kylos</h3>

The Awakening phases in Hard Mode are **Awakening 1 at 80%** and **Awakening 2 at 30%.** 
* The boss will do room wide silencing and pushback attack whenever a phase starts. **Awakening 2 is visibly slower than awakening 1, shown below.**
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Stacks on boss** - It’s recommended to count the stacks the boss has, but there are also visual cues:
  * If boss has at least 1 stack he will have **purple buff in his buff bar**, and his whole body will **glow** according to number of stacks he has. 
  * When the attack is fully charged, there will be a red glow on his wings.
**1 Stack:**

**Chain Lightning Monuments** - This mechanic will begin at at 75% and have a different variation below 40%.
* Debris will fall from the sky onto each party member. Getting hit stuns so you must move or iframe once the location locks. 
  * During this mechanic, a monument will spawn a **far distance from the boss**. **In Hard Mode, two will spawn under 40%, where one is directly next to the boss.**

**To do this correctly, you must use Chain lightning to break the monument.**
* To do this, party members must line up (3 members for the far monument, one for the closer) so that the lightning the boss creates travels through the party members to the monument.

  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/QPtNAwo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**If this mechanic is done incorrectly, party HP will be set to 1 for several seconds. You cannot be healed with this debuff active.**
* Death will remove the debuff. It is notable that parties usually do not break the far away monument unless the healer prefers it, or it is a learning run. 
  * In Hard Mode, failing both monuments is a wipe.

**4 Stack Lightning** - Once the boss has done 4 Empowered attacks during Awakening 1 or 2 Empowered attacks during Awakening 2, he will do **lightning attack that needs to be iframed**.
* The distinct animation and message (Lightning!) is **extremely quick** so a fast reaction is needed.

**Fly into Spin (left/right)** - Occasionally the boss will fly up into the air with a secondary aggro target.
* After the boss lands facing the target, he will spin on one side, casting an **unblockable expanding AoE wave**.
* Depending on the **direction of his turn, he will follow with an uniframeable & unblockable half-circle AoE**. It happens on the side he spinned to. 
  * The expanding wave goes faster during enrage.
