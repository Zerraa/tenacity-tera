**Strongly advise running the dungeon without reading this guide first.**
* You will only get confused by reading– experience it first, then try to look at this guide to understand how the mechanic works. This is just as bad as Broken Prison.

<h3>First Boss: Bandersnatch</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Counting game** - There will be a message on the screen : 

     “Open your eyes and count!”

- **Above 50% HP:** You can tell if the number of AoEs are Odd number or Even number by looking at its after effect. 
  - Red is Odd, Blue is Even.
- **Under 50% HP:** AoE after effects will be Green, so you must **manually count them**.

* Count the total number of AoEs appeared under party members. 
  * You must keep track whether the number of AoE appeared are Odd or Even every time because this will be the key for the solution to the next mechanic that may appear randomly after 1 ~ 4 times this attack occurs. 

* As an example, if this mechanic occurs 3 times, and the number of AoEs appeared were: 
  * **3 + 2 + 3 = 8**
* This is the same as : **Odd + Even + Odd = Even**
* You don’t need to do fancy math. Just know this pattern with addition: 

      Odd + Odd = Even
      Odd + Even = Odd
      Even + Even = Even

**Color Game** - A message will appear on the screen: 

     “In, or out? Out, or in?’

- **Above 50% HP**: The boss will have a message saying “Odd? or Even?” before this mechanic occurs. 
  - At this instant, you must watch for the color of the aura surrounding him.
- **Under 50% HP**: The boss will not have a message shown. 
  - Instead, you will see the color of the aura surrounding him while he puts AoE under players. 

When you start to see him glow Red or Blue, you must remember if your total sum of the previous mechanic was Odd or Even.<br>
- If the Boss glows **Blue, Even** = Donut AoE ;; **Odd** = Circle AoE
- If the Boss glows **Red, Odd** = Donut AoE ;; **Even** = Circle AoE

      Odds are Red
      Evens are Blue
      Opposites have Fled
      Alikes are Glued

<h3>Final Boss: Demoros</h3>

This guy is a bit special: at the beginning of battle, you will see the following gauge.

![](https://i.imgur.com/tbssTlH.png)

* The Red gauge represents Demoros’ Dice, while Blue represents Player’s Dice. This gauge fills up based on Demoros’ Key mechanics.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Roulette’s Color** - Watch the sphere around the map to see which direction it circles around (clockwise or counter-clockwise). 
* **It spawns when this message is announced:** 

     “Rolling…” 
     
**It stops moving when Demoros announces:** 

     “This time, it’s Red/Blue/White”. 
     
The first sphere always moves clockwise.
* Depending on which direction it spins around the map, the “Colored Dice” mechanic will be dealt differently.
  * Memorize Color and Direction.

**Colored Dice** - To clear this mechanic, you must remember the previously mentioned Color and Direction.
* With the red notice “Demoros is summoning dice!”, three dice with different colors will appear around the map.
  * Demoros will also initiate a pull, so time your iframe to avoid it.

- If the sphere’s direction was Clockwise, you must break the Colors of dice that were NOT mentioned.
- If the sphere’s direction was Counter-clockwise, you must break only the Color of die that was mentioned before.

Usually, when this mechanic is successfully done, the players roll the dice higher than Demoros here, he will be stunned briefly.

- If the players roll higher than Demoros, the next sphere spawn will be clockwise.
- If the Demoros rolls higher than the players, the next sphere spawn will be counter-clockwise.

**Multi-Dice Roll** - A message will be announced: 

     “You still think you can win?”
    
Demoros will move to the center and summon four dice around him. Then, the map will begin to draw a pattern toward the center. 
* If this pattern is filled, then Demoros will initiate wipe mechanic shortly after.
  * To prevent wiping, players must break the dice to **create a safe zone**. It is best advised to break the dice with highest value on them.
* The sum of any remaining dice on the map will be added to Demoros’ Gauge.

**FEVER TIME! Demoros is recovering in the Otherworld.**
* When Demoros’ HP falls below 30%, he will disappear from the map and regenerate his HP back to 69%. **Meanwhile, coins will fall from the sky.**
  * Blue AoE coins do not inflict damage and grant 1 points each.
  * Red AoE coins inflict 70k damage but grant 3 points each.
* Spread apart to gain as many points as possible.

**Demoros Returns – “You’re doomed!”** - When Demoros returns, he will initiate Circle and Donut attack. You must watch out for the color and remember the original color he had at the beginning of the battle.

     Same color, it will be Donut → Circle.
     Different color, it will be Circle → Donut.
    
Roulette mechanic will no longer appear, but he will recover 0.33% HP every second.
* When his HP reaches 100%, he will initiate a 90 second timer. **After the timer ends, he will wipe the party.** 

Occasionally Red AoE coins will also drop. Your party should take turns to take the coin to gain as many points as possible. Only one player can take the coin at a time.
* When he initiates colored dice mechanic, attack all three dice to roll them all.

**Remember, your ultimate goal is to reach 100 points before Demoros does to clear the dungeon.**
