| [Phase 2](#phase-2) 

<hr/>

The dungeon is broken up into two phases with the 2nd phase starting when you get **Bahaar down to 20% health**. <br>
You get loot after the first phase and you may even see LFGs for "Bahaar Farm P1" for this purpose, though probably less so now.
* Finding videos of P1 is a bit tricky since most people who regularly clear P2 would consider P1 kinda pointless.

     
      The key to understanding Bahaar is to look at his hammer.
      If it glows red, it means he’s going to do another attack.
      All of Bahaar’s Basic Attacks have a low cooldown. 
      All of the Special Attacks have a cooldown of 30sec - 2 minutes

<h3>Phase 1</h3>

     Menma's TERA changes:

     - Phase 1 is unchanged.

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Hammer Drop** - Most common attack.
* If the hammer glows, he will follow this with a Right Hand Smash that isn’t blockable but is iframeable.

</video></center>

**Hammer Toss** - The second basic attack is a Hammer Toss to the rear that is blockable and iframeable.
* This will stun if you get hit. If the hammer glows, he will follow this with a Back Smash that is blockable and iframeable.

</video></center>

**Left hand drag** - This attack starts with a Left Hand Smash which is blockable and iframeable.
* This is **always followed by a Left Hand Drag** which is blockable but not iframeable. Tanks need to **turn their camera 180** in order to block.
  * Failure to avoid a Drag will result in a knockdown.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Spin** - Has a similar windup to the Left Hand Drag. 
* This is iframeable but not blockable. 
  * Any shield (Kaia’s, Thrall of Protection etc) will greatly reduce the damage of the spin. 
* Failure to avoid the Spin will result in a knockdown.

</video></center>

**Waves** - Bahaar begins by stomping a foot twice. He then casts four semi-circular waves on alternating sides, starting with the side he stomps. **The waves are not iframeable and not blockable.**
* The waves overlap by 2-3m, so it is difficult to walk them (unless maxed movespeed) and so movement skills are required to navigate them. 
* The two possible patterns are shown below (right stomp on right, left stomp on left):

- Right Stomp (boss perspective)

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/dBrb6fA.mp4" type="video/mp4">

- Left Stomp (boss perspective)

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/Oi3Lu1Q.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Hammer throw** - Bahaar has a **ranged check, a special attack he does if anyone is more than 8m away from the boss.** Hence, always try to stay near the boss to avoid triggering this.
* If he picks up the **hammer with his right hand**, he follows this with an outer Donut. 
* If he picks up the **hammer with his left hand**, he will summon it back to him and Crush a large AoE in front of him. 
  * The Hammer Throw is iframeable, but the Donut and Crush are neither iframeable nor blockable.

<div id="phase-2">

<h3>Phase 2</h3>

     Menma's TERA changes:

     - Once you hit him, he will enrage and have wrath buff.
     - He can’t do Wrath mechanic in the first 5 seconds of fight.
     - His Wrath gives him 30% more power instead of 20%.
       - Most attacks will oneshot a DPS.

     - He is a lot like <30% HP Bahaar from 100%. 
       - Exception of lasers. Those will proc at 30%.
     - His HP has been increased by a lot.

<center><h3>Buffs</h3></center>

**Enrage Buff** - When Bahaar enrages, he gains the Bahaar’s Rage buff on the left for 15 seconds.
* If a certain amount of damage is dealt to him within this duration, is transforms into the Bahaar’s Wrath buff on the right, which grants Bahaar a 20% power buff, but reduces his endurance by 15%.
  * Below **30%**, Bahaar **permanently enrages and permanently has the transformed buff**.

**Wipe Buff** - Every time Bahaar is **lowered below 30%**, he gains a stack of the Scorching Vengeance buff shown below.
* This buff **persists** even if you wipe the boss. At 10 stacks, Bahaar gains a huge attack speed, endurance and power Bahaar's Revenge buff and is effectively **impossible to kill**. This forces a full reset of the instance.  
  * This means there is no point engaging Bahaar when he has 9 stacks, as reducing him to 30% will apply the 10th stack forcing a wipe.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Meteors(puddles)** - Bahaar will say ‘Nothing left… but vengeance, justice, flame and blood.’, and a circle with an arrow will appear below all players. After several seconds, a Fireball will land on the circle (iframeable) and leave behind a puddle. 
* The Fireball will then roll in the direction of the arrow, so it is recommended to position such that the arrow points towards the edge of the arena to avoid hitting your party members. The Fireballs will also kill any skeletons that they roll through.

* They can also be used to kill skeletons

  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/LtYnxKy.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Shrinking Arena** - **Over the course of the fight, the boss arena shrinks.**
* First, on starting the fight, a small ring of fire appears at the edge of the room. Secondly, at 60% this ring will shrink. Finally, at 30% the ring will again shrink. 
  * As the arena shrinks, make sure to pay attention to Skeleton spawns as they have a shorter distance to travel to empower.

**Lasers** - Below 30%, Bahaar will periodically mark a Dps or Healer with the debuff shown above their head.
* After a short delay, there will be a crackling noise and he will then fire a pair of lasers from his throne which are not iframeble or blockable. Players marked with the debuff should move to the side of the boss, wait for both lasers to begin firing (the second laser is sometimes delayed), then move back to the boss as shown below.
  * Note that this can occur even during the Wave attack, in which case the marked individual should suicide to avoid griefing your team.

  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/WWD6MXg.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Meteors(wrath)** - During enrage, if Bahaar has the transformed Enrage buff, he will do the Meteor mechanic. This is the best time to burn the boss. 
* This mechanic begins with Bahaar saying 

      ‘Feel my Wrath!’ 
     
* And do a semi-circular Swipe either right (see right) or left (see left).
* This is not iframeable or blockable, but you can avoid being knocked back with Kaia’s or Thrall of Protection shield.

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/8WnTCqt.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

* He will then summon 4 sets of Meteors to land on player.
* These are blockable, and it is recommended that your party groups together so that the Tank can block this for the party. Note that damage from Meteors bypasses shields, leaving them intact. When hit by a Meteor, it applies a stacking Melting Armour endurance debuff, which should be Cleansed between each set of Meteors. 
  * On landing, these leave Bombs that will explode after a short delay, dealing heavy damage. Hence the standard practice is to group at alternate sides of the boss for each set of Meteors as shown. 

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/ozbtXzA.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

* After the fourth set, a 5 second buff will appear on the boss. This needs to be Plagued/Regressed. 
  * Once buff is removed, a new 12 second buff will appear on the boss and Bahaar **needs to be Stunned** when he raises his hand (bottom left) three times. 
  * Any attack that has a chance to stun will 100% stun during this mechanic. **The third Stun will end the attack.**
* Failure to stun properly will result in Bahaar wiping the party.

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Hammer Drop** - The non-enrage Hammer Drop is identical to Phase 1 Hammer Drop.
* Bahaar starts off dropping the head of his hammer on you which is blockable. 
* If it stays glowing, he will follow this with a Back Smash that is blockable and iframeable.
  * When enraged, the Hammer Drop becomes Right Hand Drag

</video></center>

**Right Hand Drag** - Bahaar has a basic attack which is meant to test your skill as a Tank, called the Hilt Attack. 
* Bahaar will wind up then hit you with the hilt of his hammer. 

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/OoTnEFd.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

* This attack is not iframeable, so the Tank must block it.
  * Perfect Blocking this attack will make it deal greatly reduced damage and prevent being one-shot.
  
<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/1K1uyCI.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>  
  
  * During enrage, Bahaar will always have a short delay during the windup of the Hilt Attack, and will do a double Hilt Attack.

**Hilt Attack** - Bahaar has a ranged check, a special attack he does if anyone is more than 8m away from the boss. Hence, always try to stay near the boss to avoid triggering this.
* If he picks up the **hammer with his right hand**, he follows this with an outer Donut.
* If he picks up the **hammer with his left hand**, he will summon it back to him and Crush a large AoE in front of him. 
  * The Hammer Throw is iframeable, but the Donut and Crush are neither iframeable nor blockable.

* The Hilt Attack is not iframeable, and will likely one-shot if you normal block. If Bahaar is enraged, he will do a double Hilt Attack instead of a single.

**Left Hand Drag** - Same as in Phase 1
  * As this has a large AoE that extends behind the boss, melee dps and healers should make sure to dodge this.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Spin Combo** - In Phase 2, the Spin is the final attack of a 4-part combo. Bahaar starts with a weak Right Hand Smash, which is blockable. 
* He then follows this with a weak 270 degree Spin  which is blockable and iframeable. 
* This is followed by a stronger Right Hand Smash which isn’t blockable, but is iframeable. 
* Bahaar finishes the combo with the Spin, which is iframeable but not blockable.

**Waves** - **Bahaar begins by stomping a foot twice.**
* The waves are not iframeable and not blockable. In Phase 2, the non-enraged waves are face-tankable with damage reduction skills, but the enraged waves deal very heavy damage.

Left Stomp Start:

Right Stomp Start:

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/KUambnP.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

* The waves are the same speed enraged and non-enraged. The waves overlap by 2-3m, so it is difficult to walk them (unless maxed movespeed) and so movement skills are required to navigate them. Below 60% HP, Bahaar will make one of two statements as he begins stomping. 

      ‘Scream, you weaklings! Those will be your last words.’
     
* Those will be your last words.’ means that the second wave will be faster than normal.     

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/jD0fkTz.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>
     
      ‘I...am...the Fire Lord!’

* Means that the third wave will be faster than normal.

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/dUCAUuX.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

  * After the waves, Bahaar does an outer Donut that will push away anyone more than 10m away (likely ending up in the fire). 
  * If anyone gets hit by the outer Donut or outranges the Wave, Bahaar will say ‘I shall not tolerate such disrespect!’ and do an instant Front Dunk on the culprit.
  
**Hammer Throw** - The second basic attack is a Hammer Toss to the rear that is blockable and iframeable, and will stun if you get hit.
* Bahaar will follow this with a Hilt Attack which the tank must Perfect Block.
* If the hammer glows during the Hammer Toss, he will instead follow this with a Back Smash that is blockable and iframeable.

</video></center>

**Ress bait** - Using Resurrection in Phase 2 will trigger Bahaar to attack you. Bahaar will either do a Front Dunk (if hammer is in right hand) which is iframeable but not blockable, or an Eviscerate (if hammer is in left hand) blockable but not iframeable. 
* The Eviscerate is delayed if non-enraged, but instant in enraged.
  * Failure to avoid the Dunk will result in a knockdown (if you survive). Failure to avoid the Eviscerate will result in a knockup (if you survive).

**Skeletons** - Below 90%, Bahaar will begin spawning skeletons.
* These cannot normally be killed, and will walk slowly to the edge of the room. On reaching the fire, they will glow red and empower, then begin walking back towards the boss. 

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/Mz3YHDV.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

* The skeletons spawn with a 60 second timer above their heads, and once this reaches 0 they will die. 
  * **On reaching Bahaar, they will explode** in a large circular AoE, dealing heavy damage and knocking down (can be prevented using Kaia’s/Thrall of Protection shield).
  * The first is to Sleep the skeletons, which will stop them from moving. The skeletons spawn with a 60 second timer above their heads, and once this reaches 0 they will die.
