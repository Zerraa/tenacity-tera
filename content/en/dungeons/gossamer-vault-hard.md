<h3>First Boss: Hellgramite</h3>
<center><h3>Entering combat</h3></center>
Upon entering combat of this boss, a text appears in the middle of the screen :

     “Who’s there”
     
He proceeds to attack the front then follows up with a **multi-tick HP drain which does about 130-150% of your HP**. 
* Healers should use Kaia/TOP. Priest can use Healing Immersion when HP is about 70-80% while in the midst of the healing zone so you heal yourself as well
* Mystics should summon TOL at about 70-80% HP and prepare motes to heal up after the mechanic.

**Slow/Fast mode** - This means ALL his attacks will be affected by this attack speed change. Time your iframes accordingly. 
* The first mode will ALWAYS be slow. There’s a permanent DOT debuff that stacks up over the course of the fight (Uncleansable)

**Pushback into dmg pulses** - When this text appears in the middle of the screen:

     “Ugh, I can’t take it anymore”

All party members should gather to the back of the boss.Getting hit by the pushback knocks you to the edge of the map.The pushback is iframeable. 
* This attack is affected by the attack speed the boss currently has. <br>
After the end of this mechanic, he switches his attack speed. Slow > Fast and Vice Versa. <br>
* (At last, I’m Sated= Slow) (I hunger..= Fast) 
  * IF the attack speed is **SLOW**: <br>
Long wind up animation > Pushback > 3 Strong ticks with the final one dealing 50% HP in damage(Can survive solo with 1 50%HP pot). <br>
Healers should heal up the party and self after taking damage from the first tick   
  * IF the attack speed is **FAST**: <br>
Fast wind up animation > Pushback > Multi tick HP drain (Same as the mechanic that occurs when you first enter combat with the boss)  
* **IF your tank is a lancer**, he or she should Guardian Barrier the pushback for the party for the fast attack speed mechanic.  

**8-Way “Pizza” Mechanic** - At 50% onwards, the boss punches his fists then proceeds to do an 8-way attack that does 80% HP per hit.
* The areas that get hit are the front left/right, Left/right & Back left/right, 4 of the zones get slammed once while the back two are slammed twice, None of these slams can be iframed and the two inner back slams stuns players in its range. 
* **This is affected by his attack speed.**

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Secondary Aggro into Jump** -  This now comes with a falling rock that falls right after you evade the initial knockup. Rock is NOT iframeable but can be avoided if you are able to jump out of the hitbox in time.
* This attack can be triggered if someone gets hit by side push.
* **<30% HP** Getting hit by the knock-up triggers a charge stampede towards the player that got hit by it.
  * **This is affected by his attack speed.**

**Stun** - If he does an unchained stun, the stun hits behind the tank(can be iframed) and deals a flat 60% HP, after which he drags his claws towards himself
* Blockable by turning your camera towards the claws
* As a lancer you can also use **Challenging Shout** to take the stun while still being able to use your skills.

**Front/Back Push** - Boss will do this when his tail has a distinct glow.Getting hit by this will result in an attack speed debuff.(20% Attack speed slow for 8 seconds) 
* This is NOT cleansable. This is iframeable. 
* **This is affected by his attack speed.** 

**Side Knockback** - Boss will do this when his front claws glow. Getting hit by this will trigger the Jump mechanic.
* **This is affected by his attack speed.** 

**OUT-IN** - Simple OUT-IN mechanic,however the inner AOE strike zone differs from front/back/side. 
* (15m from the front, 10m from the side/5m from the back) 
* **This is affected by his attack speed.** 

**Knock up Stampede** - At 30% onwards, any player who gets hit by a knockup(Jump or frontal charged claw smash) will trigger the boss to chase after them whilst attacking multiple times. 
* **This is affected by his attack speed.**

<h3>Last Boss: Gossamer Regent</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Debuffs (Clone)** - A message appears : 

     “You’re transfixed by the Regent’s illusions”

During this mechanic, the floor turns black and the boss summons a cloned version of herself. <br>
The clone will be summoned opposite of her. If the boss does a backstep before summoning the clone, the clone will appear at her original location. <br>
* **Taking the debuff inflicts 70% of your HP**, hence healers would need to keep your party members healthy afterwards.
![](https://i.imgur.com/PNYl09R.png)
* Party members will need to rotate taking the debuffs between real/cloned as the debuff phase will happen again when the previous debuff is at ~25 seconds.
* Taking the same debuff twice kills you and causes an explosion around you that can hit allies.
  
      REAL Boss - Yellow debuff (red orb)
      CLONE - Red debuff (purple orb)

![](https://i.imgur.com/1vBqYdN.png)  
  
  * This mechanic will first occur at 80% and exactly every min after.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Spin** - Boss might do  the same IN/OUT AoE multiple times in a row. First happens on 95% HP.
  * The boss does either a inner AOE or Outer AOE depending on the glow of its wings. 

<center>
<table>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td>Unchanged wings</td>
         <td>Darkened wings</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>
</center>

**Crystal drain** - A text appears:

     “Gossamer Regent is absorbing power from the crystal”
     
Having 3 or less members results in a wipe.You will need a full party to gather to get through this mechanic. <br>
However, unlike NM, this now comes with an AOE pool under every player that is NOT iframeable but can be avoided by getting out of it’s hitbox right after the drain. <br>
* The AOE follows you until the end of the drain, do not move too early or you risk killing your allies. 
* Party members should gather behind the boss to make healing easier for your healer. This mechanic will first happen at 75%.     

**Bombs** - Occasionally, these bombs will appear on players that are afflicted with the debuffs.
* The signal for this is that the edge of **your screen will glow orange** and you will receive a 5 second debuff which will place the bomb at your current location once it expires. 
  * These bombs will take ~10 seconds to explode normally BUT will explode immediately if hit by the in/out mechanic done by the boss. 
  * If hit by these bombs, they will do roughly 80% of your HP and apply a short silencing debuff. 
  * This will first occur after the first debuffs take place ( ~78-80%HP)

**Front Stab > Push Back** - Front Stab is iframeable, Pushback is not iframeable. 
* The best way to deal with this is to get to where the tank is and the tank repositions to the front afterwards.
  * Both front stab and pushback inflicts a DOT debuff if failed to avoid (uncleansable)
  
**Resurrection Bait** - A text appears:

     “ I shall harvest your soul”. 

* The boss will then do a quick push similar to the Stab and pushback mechanic. **This time however, it’s iframeable.**
* Failing to iframe will push you back, dealing 80% of your HP and inflict a DOT debuff (uncleansable). 
  * Holy Burst/Corruption Ring will prevent the knockback.
