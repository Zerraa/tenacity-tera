<h3>First Boss: Pahoegar</h3>

For tanks in Hard Mode he hits a lot tougher when he's not enraged where it may bleed through your block. <br>
Using Infuriate at the start of the fight is a good idea where it won't bleed through block.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Pillars** - Message shown on the center of your screen. 

     "Pahoegar is gathering power"

This mechanic will begin when the boss reaches **94% HP** and then **repeats about every 50-60 seconds** (Normal Mode) from now on. In Hard Mode it repeats around every 40-50 seconds.
- In Normal Mode, up to 3 players will have a dark orb floating above their heads where a pillar will be placed on the ground from where you stand after a few seconds. In hard mode, this targets up to 4 players.

You **won't be targeted by this mechanic if you have the highest aggro** and if you are a healer in normal mode. In **Hard Mode everyone is targeted** by this except for the highest aggro player. 

- In hard mode, these pillars will target someone and shoot lasers that will cause major damage. 

<center><video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/3vGdAA6.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

Try to **position them diagonally** behind the boss the best as you can because as the pillars remain there it will cause multiple AoEs and other effects dealing damage to your party that can be a nuisance. <br><br>
The only way to *destroy the pillar* are with lasers from the boss. Make sure you place them close together as possible so you can take them all out with just one laser. If you missed one you'll get more chances. 

<center><video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/X6KLZp5.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Shield** - As long as one pillar remains active, the boss can trigger a shield. He will run to the pillar and kneel down for 10 seconds.
* Successfully breaking the shield will stop him from one-shotting the group and one pillar will be destroyed in the process. 
* If failed to break the shield within 10 seconds, the entire party will wipe. 

In hard mode, even if you try to res after a wipe he'll keep repeating this wipe until everyone dies regardless. <br>
The wipe even bypasses damage immunity from Goddess Blessing as well.

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Laser** - Boss will tell a message on the center of your screen:
 
    "<Name>, can you dodge this?"
    
Look at his tiny hand to see the exact timing to i-frame the laser. <br>
Getting hit by this will result taking exactly 100,000 direct damage in normal mode. In **Hard Mode** you'll take exactly 300,000 direct damage.

**Hand Slam + Swing** - There are two types of this attack. 
- In Normal Mode, it's the only attack that shows a telegraph indicators underneath him so you should know which hand slam he's doing. <br>
If there's a circle around him then he'll swing around him.
- In **Hard Mode**, you have to trust your instincts after he slams his hand down whether he'll swing around or not. Just have to play by feel on this one. 

**Rush Attack** - He'll plop his arm off, points at the tank, and charges in swinging his drumstick arm around like a maniac. 
- In Normal Mode, if you block before the attack is done you can stop him from moving. 
- In **Hard Mode**, this attack will push as you block so you can't stop him from moving and you'll be pushed back.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Drop, Pound, Stomp, and Pound Again** - As name suggests, this attack has multiple moves.
1. 1st attack will drop his arm on the ground attacking in front.
2. 2nd attack will pound his other arm on the ground attacking the front again.
3. 3rd attack will stomp his foot on the ground hitting around the boss so it will hit your DPS party who are behind the boss. 
4. 4th attack will pick up his dropped arm and attacking in front.

**Websplosion** - Message shown on the center of your screeen:

     "Must... rest..."

He'll kneel down and summon AoE circles individually in a pattern.

<h3>Second Boss: Dakuryon</h3>

Before the tank approaches the boss, have any healer use a resurrection skill and cancel the animation so the healer will be targeted first giving your group enough time to get in before the boss attacks the tank. 

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

None. Just dodge pizzas and burn him down.

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Uppercut** - The boss kneels down for a brief moment and then makes a swift uppercut that hits in a straight line that cannot be blocked. 
* In Normal Mode if you see a straight line telegraph on the ground then you'll know that it's this attack. 

**Swing Back** - Dakuryon's bracelet starts rotating around his wrist indicating that he'll **swing backwards and hit anyone behind him**.
* Getting hit by this only take minor damage so if you have a trustful healer you could keep DPSing. 

**Circle AoE** - Once his weapon is placed down and then raises his arm up, he'll summon an AoE circle around him that does major damage.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Blue Pizza Slice** - Message shown on the center of your screen. 

    "Dakuryon is tapping the Bloodshards!"

- In Normal Mode this mechanic happens every 95%, 75%, 55%, and 35%.
- In Hard Mode this mechanic happens every 90%, 70%, 50%, 30%. 

Run to the first blue pizza slice to avoid taking heavy damage, after that a small circle will show up around the boss, then run towards the second blue pizza slice that will always be placed somewhere on the opposite side from where the first blue pizza was located. 

<center><video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/TxLv2Te.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

You cannot i-frame this attack as soon as the ground explodes, but **you can use skills that absorbs damage like Warp Barrier, Recall, and Smoke Screen**. 

In *Hard Mode*, the **blue color pizza slice at 50% and 30% will not be displayed on the ground** so you need to pay closer attention to the slice area that doesn't flash red and that will be your safe zone to stand on. <br><br>
Watch the ripple effect where the 3rd ripple that passes signals that it'll explode so you'll know how much time you have to get out. 

**Mobs** - More mobs will spawn for the next phases. 
* In Hard Mode this mechanic happens every 95%, 75%, 55%, and 35%. More mobs will spawn for the next phases.
* The boss will target a random person up to three times with a small laser. You can also lure the laser into the mobs that will kill them. **The laser can be blocked.** 
  * While the boss is shooting small lasers he'll have a **temporary barrier to take less damage**.

<center><video controls>

</video></center>

**Light Bulb** - Balls will spawn in the room and will rotate around the room that cannot be destroyed so just avoid them. 

**Lava Floor (Hard Mode Only)** - This mechanic happens every 80%, 60%, and 40%.
* Red floors will spawn up to fives times in a row and it will one-shot you. 
  * You **cannot i-frame** this attack as soon as the ground explodes, but you **can use skills that absorbs damage** like Warp Barrier, Recall, and Smoke Bomb.

**Burn Phase** - Message shown on the center of your screen: 

    "Dakuryon is absorbing power from the Bloodshard!"

When the boss reaches 20% he'll automatically enter this phase where you have 20 seconds to burn him down to 10% HP to end the fight.

<h3>Last Boss: Imperator (Dakuryon)</h3>

Before the tank approaches the boss, have any healer use a resurrection skill and cancel the animation so the healer will be targeted first giving your group enough time to get in before the boss attacks the tank. 

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Cage #1** - Begins when boss goes below 85% HP and repeats this periodically. 
* Message shown on the center of your screen. 

     "Dakuryon summons soldiers"

Mobs have spawn around the room that needs to be killed. **Mobs doesn't have much HP** so even healers can help out and they are also susceptible to some Crowd Control skills like stun, sleep, etc.

<center><video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/973k1GE.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

Few seconds later he will form a **cage around him so you need to get inside** before it closes or else you'll die.

Leftover mobs that wasn't killed on time will transform into a different creature where they periodically spit fireballs around the room that you need to avoid. <br>
Inside the cage will form donuts and pizza slices on the ground that you have to move out or i-frame that deals lots of damage. <br>
Kaia's Shield could probably protect you from one shotting you. 

The amount of mobs will grow in numbers during each phases as you progress further. 

<center><video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/CSFRWfL.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Cage #2** - Begins when boss goes below 75% HP and repeats this periodically. 
* Message shown on the center of your screen. 

      "Dakuryon is using the Bloodshard's power!"

The boss will **slowly slam the hilt of his weapon** the ground twice knocking players back. 

Few seconds later **he will form a cage** around him so you need to get inside before it closes or else you'll die.

Inside the cage will form donuts and pizza slices on the ground that you have to move out or i-frame that deals lots of damage. <br>
Kaia's Shield could probably protect you from one shotting you. 

**Cage Debuff (Hard Mode)** - Only happens in hard mode and **triggers once the boss reaches below 40%**.
* Whenever he does Cage #1 or #2 you may be given a debuff with a random number before the pizza and donut mechanic appears inside the cage.
* You need to purposely get hit by the donut/pizza to remove the debuff. <br>
For example if you have the debuff with 3 stacks then you need to deliberately get hit three times to remove this.

<center><video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/TZZ85mN.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

The debuff gives you higher endurance as long as you have it so that means getting hit by the balls will take minor damage to you as well. 

**If you do not remove the debuff entirely before duration runs out, you'll die.**

**Targetting (Hard Mode)** - Only happens in Hard Mode. 
* Message shown on the center of your screen. 

      "Dakuryon is retargeting"

He'll pound his weapon down twice. The first attack will suck you towards him if you get hit.

After the two ground pound attack, whoever is closest to the boss will get **debuff that lasts 2 minutes**. 

<center><video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/WVEDZM4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

If you get **two stacks of this debuff** then you are in *deep trouble*. The boss will pierce his blade into your flesh and starts flailing you around. <br>
Your party should back away because they will take damage during the massacre. After he finishes beating you to death he will target one of the furthest party member and fling your dead corpse towards your ally killing both in the process. 

Your party can dodge this if you can time it right. Then finally he'll finish it off with Normal Attack #5. Hell is over now. 

**If this becomes an issue then assign the order on who takes debuff while you wait for the 2 minute debuff to be over.**

<center><video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/E9WATMv.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Burn Phase (Hard Mode)** - Only happens in Hard Mode. 
* Once the boss reaches below 15% a 2 minute timer will begin counting down. 
* Once the timer reaches zero he will go into frenzy mode where he becomes incredibly fast. 

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Attack Pattern Visual Aid** - There are several patterns to this attack so you need to know how it looks like and have quick reflexes to avoid getting hit.
* **Pattern A** only swings his weapon down once and that's the end of it. 
* **Pattern B** is when he swings his weapon down, pauses for a brief moment, and then launches a side sweeping wave attack on either side. <br>
The side sweep attack will knock you back and if you get hit by this in Hard Mode you'll get a bleed that can be cleansed. 
* **Pattern C** is when he swings his weapon down and either does a front or back slam that does heavy damage and it cannot be blocked. <br>
You'll need quick reflexes whenever you see this happening. 

Once you get familiar fighting him multiple times, you can just look at his stance and the way he swings his weapon down and you'll immediately know what he'll do. 

**Attack Pattern Sequences** 
* Attack **Pattern One**
  * If he twirls his weapon around, then he's preparing to attack three times in a row on one of the following patterns below:
     * Left  > Right  > Back
     * Left > Back > Right 
     * Right > Back > Front
     * Right > Left > Front

![](https://i.imgur.com/TC5Aqrf.png)

* Attack **Pattern Two**
  *  If he begins with a front or back slam attack out of nowhere then he's preparing to execute one of the following patterns below:
     * Front > Right > Back
     * Front > Left > Back
     * Back > Left > Right 
     * Back > Front > Right 

![](https://i.imgur.com/pOCJclr.png)

Once you understand these patterns you'll naturally get used to knowing what he'll do before it even happens.

  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/QVHU4Cm.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Stab Combination** - There are two patterns to this attack.
* He'll do a stab attack and then a 360 swing knocking nearby people back. 
* He'll do a stab attack and follows up with an uppercut where you must get to the inside the donut. 
  * You can i-frame the explosion if you can't make it in time. 

**Ressbait(double circle)** - This is **VERY important to healers** because you are expected to be targeted by this often.
* This usually targets the person that are furthest from the boss.
* Using **Resurrection skills** (Hard Mode only) will automatically trigger this attack if the boss isn't doing anything else. This may only work up to two times in a row.

1. The first AoE circle will be stationary so you will have time to simply move out. 
2. The second AoE circle will follow you until it explodes no matter where you go so you must i-frame this at the precise moment or if you are a Mystic then you could use 

Corruption Ring (glyphed) to take half damage to survive if you are having trouble timing the i-frame. <br>
The timing to i-frame the second AoE is right after the visual of the first AoE ring disappears. However in hard mode once he gets a power buffs you have to dodge a bit earlier. 

<center><video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/tSx6xTk.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Everyone has Circle** - Just i-frame right before the 2nd ripple touches the edge of the circle. 

**Peek-a-boo** - He'll disappear behind your DPS group to try and flank you. 

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Power Up** - He'll get a **buff at 60%, 40%, and 20%**.
* Message shown on the center of your screen:

      "Dakuryon is gathering energy" 

* Power and Attack Speed will increase per stack.
That means specific attacks where you had to time your i-frame will be much sooner so keep that in mind. 

**Shield Phase** - **Triggers on 70% and 50%.**
* Message shown on the center of your screen:

      "Dakuryon has a new target!"

Boss will **target the person with the highest aggro** (aka the tank) and that person have a few seconds to **get as far away** from the boss as possible.
* In hard mode you have little time to get away compared to normal mode. You'll know you have it if you have a creepy eye displayed above your head. 

Tank will be stunned when time is up and the boss will slowly run towards the tank while the boss has a shield on himself. 

<center><video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/735pcE2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

The amount of time your group has to **break the shield** determines how far the tank is away from the boss.

- If your group manages to break the shield on time before reaching the tank, the tank will live.
- If your group failed to break the shield on time, the boss will stab the tank and fling his body towards another person killing both of them. <br>
Anybody else that gets near will also die as well so stay away from someone that has a purple circle. 

Regardless if you succeed or failed on this mechanic, the boss will do Normal Attack #5 afterwards.
