<h3>First Boss: Mulmok</h3>

Normal tank and spank boss. You should aim to keep the boss tanked in a corner at the back to avoid barrels.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Enraged Mulmok** - When Mulmok’s HP reaches **75%**, **50%** and **25%**, he’ll receive a buff which makes him stronger for the rest of the fight. 
* Killing the Powder Monkey also applies this buff.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Powder Monkey** - During the fight, Powder Monkey will spawn (**90%**), he will summon self destructing barrels on the field every 15 seconds. **Standing near one will cause very high damage and knockdown.** 
* Powder Monkey will disappear and re-appear to spawn more barrels. 
  * He will announce a players name : 

     “Prepare to meet your maker, (Player)!“
     
* And strike that player, knocking them back.

**Minions** - When Mulmok’s HP reaches **80%**, **60%**, **40%** and **20%**, minions will spawn. 
* These **must be killed within 30 seconds**, otherwise they’ll flock and be absorbed by Mulmok, healing him by 2%.

<h3>Second Boss: Fina</h3>

Tanking this boss in a corner makes DPSing easier as your party will only need to deal with one Dangerous Device.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Dangerous Devices** - There will be 3 devices around the field when Fina reaches 90% HP. 
* The devices, by default, are under the control of Fina and are positioned so that each one roughly covers a third of the room.

* When under the control of Fina, they project a Corrupted Aura which aids her. 
* * **Fina will receive a Power/Defense Bonus, which stacks up to 10 times, for every 3 seconds she is inside a devices’s Corrupted Aura (which is marked on the ground by a **orange circle**).** 
  * Your DPS must kill the totem and break Fina’s control, the totem will then become blue and project a Purified Aura. It will no longer aid Fina and her buff will run out after 15 seconds.

When the totem projects a Purified Aura, it will begin to aid players inside its purified area. 
* Players will receive a Power/Defense Bonus. which stacks up to 10 times, for every 3 seconds they are inside a totem’s Purified Aura (which is marked on the ground by a **blue circle**)

**Sleep and Stagger** - Like other crab-like bosses and BAMs, Fina has the ability to cast an AoE sleep skill around her. 
* She will stand tall on her legs, flash her eyes red, then retract and excrete a sleeping gas.

* She will also spawn little crabs which can become annoying due to their staggering attacks.

<h3>Last Boss: Barbosa</h3>

This boss is a normal tank and spank boss, he will move around a lot so be aware.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Sea Disease** - During the fight the message : 

     “The sea gives up it’s dead”
     
Appears and a player will be chosen at random. Four sorcerers will spawn at the edges of the field and fire Arcane Pulses at the chosen player. 
* Be careful as these pulses hit high static damage towards the chosen player and can kill you if you take too many to the face. 
  * **You must kill all four to proceed as the boss will be immune to damage during this time.**

**Enraged Barbosa** - Barbosa will begin to summon the darkness :

     “Darkness, I summon you!
     
* You must stun him and interrupt his summon or else he will become stronger for a set duration of time.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Rage** - Barbosa will begin to roar and rage, displaying immense power before slamming the ground with a deadly frontal hit.
