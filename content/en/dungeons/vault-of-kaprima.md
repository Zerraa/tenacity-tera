<h3>First Boss: Agarta</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Drills** - When Agarta hits 90% of her total HP, drills will spawn on either side of the room. This is where players must focus on the field, as well as the boss. 
* The drills will deal fatal damage and apply a harmful effect if you are hit by them.

They activate at certain intervals of the fight:
- **90%** – Up to 3 Drills will activate and pierce the room.
- **70%** – 4 Drills will activate and piece the room.
- **50%** and below – A random amount of Drills will activate and piece the room.

- Players must avoid being hit by drills by standing infront of the non-active drills. 
**Active drills will be noted by an orange danger zone and the actual drill will begin to rotate.** Standing behind Agarta will protect players as well.

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Pincers** - Agarta’s basic attacks involve her pincers. She will often use these to attack the player with the aggro and nearly all attacks will only do damage in front of her. She may alternate between her left and right pincer, or use combo attacks such as 6 consecutive blows or 1 large attack from above.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>
 
**Roundhouse** - Agarta will also use her pincers to deal damage whilst he spins, this will do damage to anyone close enough to the boss.

**Body Slam** - During the fight, Agarta may jump into the air and slam the ground with great force, causing a shockwave of damage. 
* Players who are near to Agarta when he makes contact with the ground will receive damage.

### Pathway #2
- Following the path to the second boss will lead you to more mechanics, involving debuffs and statues. The only way past is to defeat them in a particular way.

**Blue Statues and Priests** - These statues emit a blue aura, entering this aura will cause players MP to be drained. 
* Priests will begin spawning as you approach this statue which will debuff and reduce your endurance, up to 10 stacks. 
  * You must defeat this statue to proceed.

**Red Statues** - These statues/pillars emit a harmful aura, entering this aura will cause you to take continual damage and reduced power/endurance. 
* Player skills will not work on these statues, you **must use normal/basic attacks** to move the statues.

<h3>Second Boss: Kornus</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Red Statues**  - Similar to the statues you met in the pathway. These statues/pillars emit a harmful aura, entering this aura will cause you to take continual damage and reduced power/endurance. 
* Player skills will not work on these statues, you must use normal/basic attacks to move the statues. 
  * Kornus will spawn these during the battle, announced by : 

     “Have you been enjoying my little traps?” 
     
- Your DPS should push these out of the way so killing the boss is easier.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Weakened** - Kornus likes to play with defense, he’ll shout 

     “Do you really think my traps are my only trick?”
     
And then will strike infront of himself. 
* If a player is hit, their weapon’s defense is reduced by **70%**. 
  * Lancers and Warrior Tanks will need to worry about this as blocking hits with this debuff will proceed to drain Resolve quickly. 
  * Kornus will only use this on the player with the **highest aggro.**

**Leash** - Kornus will begin to leash the statues to his location when his HP goes below 50%, your DPS will have to push them again. He’ll say :

     “It will take more than just pushing some statues around!”

**Strengthen** - He’ll also shout 

     “Let me show you an impenetrable defense!” 
     
Begin to cast a spell which increases his defense by 500. **During the casting, he is immune to damage.** 
* **Your healer has 7 seconds to cast their Regression (Mystic) or Plague of Exhaustion (Priest).**
* This can stack up to 10 times, meaning 5000 extra defense.

**Charge** - At 70% and below, Kornus will select one random member and charge in a straight line towards them. 
* This is notified by a danger zone on the ground and Kornus shouting : 

     “Die, you puny bugs!”

<h3>Last Boss: Kaprima Reborn</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Pentagrams** - Kaprima will slam the ground with immense power, you must pay attention to either the words she speaks or the damage indicators as this will notify you whether the damage area is small, or large.
* If the damage area is directly beneath Kaprima, in a small circle, she’ll say: 
  
      “Irritating pests…! I shall exterminate you!”

* If the damage area is a larger area around Kaprima, she’ll say: 

      “Vermin! I will wipe you out… all of you!”

Getting hit will cause you to take on **“Curse of Kaprima”** which applies a damage over time debuff, as well as **increases damage received by Kaprima by 30% for 15 seconds**.

**Cursed Ritual** - Kaprima will retain her wipe mechanic, after announcing : 

     “What’s the meaning of this? You leave me no choice”

  * The room’s floor will be covered in pentagrams.

* A player will then be chosen at random, they will be stunned and have a small circle zone around them. **A few moments later, that player will be encased in a snake head, shielding them from Kaprima’s ritual and escaping death.** 
  * In order for the other players to survive, they must **quickly move themselves and stand inside this small zone** before the snake head appears, so that they are encased as well.
