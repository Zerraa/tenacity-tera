<h3>First Boss: Pepero</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Protect the Kegs!** - Throughout the fight, mobs will spawn:

     “Suicide Soldiers are targeting the X! 
     Break an oak barrel and use Inferno Spores to take them out“

Players will have to **prevent these mobs from destroying** the different Piles (Wine Barrels, Bomb Piles, Gunpowder Boxes, or Oil Barrels) in each corner of the arena. If any Pile is destroyed a message appears:

     “An explosion has damaged the ship!”

* The mobs cannot be CC-d by the player.
* If all of the Piles are destroyed, the party wipes.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Inferno Spores** - There will be barrels that spawn on the edges of the room. 
  * Breaking these will give nearby party members Inferno Spores, which deals flat damage every second to enemy monsters around the player. 
* Players should use this to defeat the monsters that spawn to protect the barrel kegs.
  * These spores damage friendly players as well.

**Ground Pound** - Pepero will raise his arms, shout :
     
     “Get back!”
     
Before pounding the ground multiple times, dealing frontal damage.
* Pepero will leave damaging AoE puddles on the ground. These AoE puddles deal damage per tick.

**Pushback** - Pepero will glow red, and unleash a frontal shockwave. His next attack directed towards his side and will players back.

**Shockwave** - Pepero will go into the center of the room and proceed to unleash frontal shockwaves four times in a counter-clockwise fashion. Each one of these will deal flat damage and is not blockable.
* After 50% HP, Pepero will have a different shockwave attack pattern.

**Ground Slam** - There will be a large mid-range ring. After a few seconds, Pepero will slam down and deal massive damage to players inside the affected area.

<h3>Second Boss: </h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Overload!** - You’ll notice a bar. It will start at 0/100. 
* The more bomb monsters there are on the field, the higher the bar fills. 
  * Once the bar reaches 100, all bombs will explode and Polyphemus will rapidly fire lasers.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Bombs** - Stationary bomb monsters will occasionally spawn. These will activate once a player or the boss steps onto the area, stunning players and/or the boss.

**Hop** - Polyphemus will jump upwards before landing, dealing damage to nearby players.

**Laser** - Polyphemus will fire a laser towards a random target that will deal damage and leave the ground scorched, dealing damage to players standing in the area.

**Ripples** - Polyphemus will stomp on the ground, creating three earthquakes with expanding size.

**Leap** - Happens when Polyphemus says : 

     “Polyphemus is targeting (Player)
     Lure him to the bomb squad!” 
     
* Polyphemus will begin charging a powerful attack. After a few seconds, Polyphemus will jump towards that player. 
  * The player should aim to move so that Polyphemus will land onto a bomb so he can be stunned. **He will then proceed to do Earthquake.**

**Earthquake** - If Polyphemus is not stunned by a bomb after Leaping, he will unleash two waves of damage (iframeable) across the entire arena, dealing flat damage.
* Polyphemus does not announce who he is targeting (although there is still the secondary aggro purple circle).
* The waves will deal high damage, which has a much higher probability of killing players who failed to dodge.

**Petrification** - Polyphemus will target a random player and fire a large conal attack that deals heavy damage and leave a debuff that will petrify a player after a few seconds if not cleansed.

**Bomb Sparks** - Players are warned by :
 
     “Look Out!“
     
* After a few seconds a number of players will receive a large orange circle. After a few seconds, they will be knocked up for a long period of time.

<h3>Last Boss: Kalivan</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Flooding** - Throughout the fight, quarters of the arena will be flooded in water. The water doesn’t deal damage by itself, though **if you are electrified with Electricity Overload, you will take damage.**
* Water lanes will flood more often as the fight goes on.

### **Electricity Overload** 
- Certain attacks will **apply Electricity Overload on players for 45 seconds**. 
  - If players step into Flooded areas while they have Electricity Overload, any player in the area takes damage. Electricity Overload will stack up to five times. 
  - Getting two stacks of Electricity Overload will apply Electric Shock Overload, which is a damage over time debuff that can be cleansed. 
  - Getting five stacks of Electricity Overload will stun the player.

**Electricity Bomb** - Kalivan will throw a projectile at players at a distance. Players hit by this will receive damage and **Electricity Overload**.

**Mini Lightning Bolts** - Kalivan will shout : 

     “Behold my thunderous wrath!” 

Before placing circles on all players. 
* After a duration, the circles will solidify and players have a short period to escape before the circles explode, dealing damage and applying Electricity Overload to players who failed to escape. 
* He will proceed to do Big Lightning Bolt immediately after.

**Big Lightning Bolt** -  Message of :  

     “(Player) is targeted by Big Lightning Bolt”
     
* Is announced and a random player is targeted for an attack.
  * The player will be stunned and will be struck with heavy damage in 6 seconds. 
* Party members should stay inside the target circle in order to split the damage taken.
* If taken solo, will deals very high damage to a single player. Mystic thralls, Gunner ST-4 and Warrior shadows count as extra bodies to help split the damage. 
  * If no player is inside (or if all players inside die) when the Lightning strikes, Kalivan will proceed to do Lightning Storm.

**Lightning Storm** - Kalivan will shout :

Before calling lightning down from the skies, dealing massive damage to the entire field. This occurs when no player is left remaining inside the Big Lightning Bolt when it hits.

**Stomp** - Kalivan will raise up on his hind legs and stomp onto the ground, dealing massive damage and applying Electricity Overload.

**Ground Piercing** - Kalivan will flash his eye red, before stabbing the ground in front of him four times, each one applying Electricity Overload.

**Charge!** - Kalivan will shout out :

    “Preparing to charge towards (Player)!! Watch out!” 
    
Before repeatedly slashing at his selected target. Getting hit by these slashes will apply heavy damage and Electricity Overload.

     “You won’t be so lucky this time!”
