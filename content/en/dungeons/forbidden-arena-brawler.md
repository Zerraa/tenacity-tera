<h3>Boss: Undying Warlord</h3>

     MT The Dream changes:

     - In Hard mode boss cannot do Backflip til 70%.
     - Lines don't "delay".

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

<center><h4>Red Debuff</h4></center>

- Getting hit by any **fist attack**(glows red) will apply a stack.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/LLmnwKw.png">This deals 1% max hp every couple seconds and stacks to 5. Lasts 60 seconds. <br>If you do reach 5, itll turn into a separate debuff.</td>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/X9Rrrxa.png">This lasts forever and ticks for 5% max hp every few seconds.<br> If you reach 5x red debuff you will get 1 permanent red debuff and can begin stacking red debuff again. Reaching another 5x red debuff will give you 2 stacks of permanent red debuff etc.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<center><h4>Blue Debuff</h4></center>

- Getting hit by any **feet attacks**(glows blue) will apply a mana draining version for 60 seconds.

The only other **difference of HM from NM** is flying kicks of any kind will now apply **2 stacks of Mana drain**.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PNHWa6r.png">Drains 1% mp every tick.</td>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MA9VjsQ.png">This lasts forever and ticks for 5% mp every couple seconds.<br> Behaves the same as red debuff, reaching 5x mana drain = 1 permanent mana dragin. Reaching 5x mana dragon again will add another stack of permanent mana drain.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<center><h4>Purple Debuff</h4></center>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/h8p4UZC.png">This ONLY applies when you reach 3, not every 3rd hit or whatever. <br>
    You can get 4-5(resets) 1-2-3 (purple debuff will apply here). <br> If you ever reach 3 stacks, the boss will stun you for 20 seconds.</td>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BORoANc.png">He will put up a shield for 10second on 3rd stack of Purple debuff</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I5uTMqh.png">If you do not break this shield, the boss will pick the person up and launch them into the air followed by a divine wrath on them, landing and insta wiping the group. <br> You cannot recover from this, as the floor becomes lava and kills you until boss resets. Total reset if failure.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<hr/>

If you succeed in breaking the shield, the boss will gain a stack:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0mobXeB.png">If the boss reaches 10(5 on HM) stacks of this, he also wipes you. Similarly to Bahaar.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<center><h3>100% - 85%</h3></center>

<center><h3>85%</h3></center>

**Groundpounds** - The boss will clap his fists and ground pound for 3 hits, the first 2 hits causing aoe on the floor.
* If the boss is **NOT enraged**, you go **out first**: 10m is safe
* If the boss **IS enraged**, you stay **in first**: 5m is safe
  * **The final hit must always be iframed.**

If you do get hit by the first 2 hits, you will be silenced and knocked down like slayer dungeon, unable to even potion.
* The final groundpound will kill you, no exceptions.

*Wrongly done:*

<center><h3>70% Phase Change</h3></center>

At **70% the fight really starts**. The boss will pull his actual weapons out and spawn fire on the edges of the room.<br>

* **Blockable and avoidable.**

<center><h3>50% Buff</h3></center>

- The 50% buff from normal mode will apply instead at **70%** which isnt a huge deal.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QzJYKGL.png"><br> At 50% the boss will gain a buff exactly like slayer boss, gaining damage and speed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<center><h3>30%</h3></center>

Finally at 30%, the boss will unlock his final attack.

**Rhytmic Blows** - The boss will do a small version of Rhythmic Blows with very little windup. <br> 
It consists of 4 parts:
1. Windup animation
2. Sideways Hit ; Right then Left
3. Uppercut 

The side hits hit in a **VERY wide arc**, if you are not directly on his buttcrack you will get hit and get **HP Drain stacks**.

Here is an example of melee getting hit by the side hits because hes slightly off to the side. You can see how disastrous it can be if you get enough stacks.

**30% Growing fury** - In Hard mode, at 30%, the boss will use **Growing fury**, causing a **large aoe around him**, giving him a further buff to speed and power.

This mechanic will happen for the rest of the fight after time.
* You are basically required to dodge everything perfectly.
