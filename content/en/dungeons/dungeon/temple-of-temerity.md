When you first enter the instance you will notice a **little fairy with a repeatable quest** marker. **Talk to him and obtain a potion.** 
* DO NOT USE YET.

Just keep it in your bag. **This potion lasts for 3 min and has a cooldown of 20 min.** 
* This is used to **negate the silencing effect** in the boss room.

**Every 50 kills the team will receive a buff that will allow you to res on the spot.** 
* If you somehow die, wait for this buff to appear. 
* You cannot return to the dungeon if you res in town.

When everyone is ready, have someone interact with the stone to start the timer. The objective is to protect the crystal in the middle from the mobs. The room to the right will spawn 3 mobs at set intervals. 
* Kill them, and at **21 kills the first boss will spawn**.

<div id="first-boss">

## First Boss: Kuma

This is a fairly easy BAM for most classes to handle. It may be best for a **newer member or someone slightly undergeared** to take him on. 

**Use the potion from the fairy as you go in and once the 10 second silence wears off**, you'll be able to use skills again (or use the potion just before you enter the room so you won't receive the debuff). 
* **You have 3 min to kill the boss.**

If you have a Mystic in your group, they can assist by running in with the solo DPS for auras. If they've been dropping motes, your party should be fine without heals for 3 minutes at most.

During this time, **adds will continue to pour into the central room.** The tank should taunt and allow the rest to kill the mobs. 
* They can hit pretty hard.

## Second Boss: Hermit Crab

The second boss is the Hermit Crab (similar to Akasha or Thulsa). This should probably be taken care of by **someone confident in killing this type of BAM**. 
* **Again, 3 min time limit to kill the boss.**

You can practice killing this type of BAM below. If you can down this guy without getting hit, it should help greatly. 
* Note that this open world BAM has a sleep, while the one in ToT does not.

**IMPORTANT:** Just before the second boss spawns (approx. 12 min mark), **4 adds that do not move will spawn** by the boss room's entrance. 
* Have someone step in to **pull them** so they do not follow the person going in to solo the boss.

Sometime inbetween the fight, the adds will disappear and barrels will summon. These **barrels won't hurt you**. 
* Break them to kill the adds that appear.

<div id="third-boss">

## Third Boss: Arachen

The third boss is an Arachen type. You should have seen it back in Sinestral Manor (last boss). This boss is taken care of **by the tank, healer and the last DPS** who usually is a ranged class. 

All three will go in to down this boss; this boss can hit pretty hard. The *red eye attack where it smashes its claws down will cause a bleed effect* when hit. 
* This attack will hit both front and around it so melee should also dodge this.

**Spike Pad and the Gulas** - The two DPS left will keep killing the adds with barrels. Depending on the timing, it will switch onto the last Gula phase.
Spike pads will appear at both entryways with three switches. 
* **DO NOT TOUCH the Cataclysm Switch** as it has a cooldown of 3 min and is necessary to stop the Game of Death.

Wait in front of the room with the spinning lasers. As the Gulas approach the spike pads, someone will hit the switch right beside it to slow them down. 
* Watch out for their bellyflop attack as it can take out a good chunk of your HP.

</div>

Once the third boss is dead the instance will end. 
* But if you had only managed to kill the first two bosses, then you will need to keep going. 
* At some point, a screen warning will appear about the **Game of Death**. 
  * Run over to the other side and activate the spike pad. Once you see that all the mobs have entered the room, hit the Cataclysm Switch to kill them. 
  * **If you wait too long, they will put up a shield which makes them immune to the damage**, so time it correctly or you may fail.

Depending on how many bosses you have killed, you will get chests to spawn accordingly.
