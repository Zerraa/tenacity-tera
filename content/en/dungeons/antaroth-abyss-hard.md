<h3>First Boss: Ghergof</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Ice Puddle** - The boss will target one of the players with a growing red circle, once it fills it will put down an Ice patch which will be used to avoid the mechanic below.
* It is important to place this away from the boss, but not far because you’re going to need it for the “Delete This” mechanic.

**Delete This** - A text message will show up saying :

     “Your flesh will be deleted” 

* The boss will first do a map wide AoE that needs to be iframed, failure to iframe this will result a knock up and the boss targeting that person with the following Fire Breath. <br>
**This will happen before you land so you will die.**
* After the AoE it’ll target two people with a Fire Breath which can be survived by going into the Ice Patch.

**Massive In-Out** - This one is decided by whether or not the boss is enraged. 
* The first part of this mechanic is a map wide AoE that needs to be iframed. 

      Enraged: Big AoE, Inner AoE, Outer AoE
      Not enraged: Big AoE, Outer AoE, Inner AoE

</video></center>

**Double AoE** - In this mechanic he will put a circle under every single party member, the DPS and the healer need to stack behind the boss while the tank moves back a little bit.
* It will then do an AoE with the safe spot being where people are gathered and on the tank. 
* Directly afterwards it will do an AoE on the safe spots, so you have to iframe directly as the red circle disappears.

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Shish Kebab** - Simple 1-hit attack <br>
**Slash** - Simple 1-hit attack. <br>
**Double Slash** - Same like above, but twice <br>
**4x Slash** - Same like above, but four times <br>
**Jump** - The boss jumps at the tank, often used when the tank is away from the boss.<br>
**Jumping Jack** - Boss jumps sideways and back multiple times, actual boss hitbox stays in the middle. 

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Shield AoE** - An AoE attack that also hits behind the boss.
* Getting hit by this attack will knock you back.

**Shield Barrage** - A barrage of hits on the tank.
* Will push back the tank.

**Small AoE** - A small AoE being put on one of the members, it can be blocked and iframed.

**In-Out or Out-In** - On this boss it is decided by whether or not the boss backsteps or not.
* If the boss backsteps it will do an outer AoE followed by an inner AoE.

<h3>Second Boss: Kalioth</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Debuffs** - A text message will show up on the screen saying : 

     ”Sacrificial target selected.” 
     
**The boss will then gain a Blue or Red colored Aura.** Followed an AoE attack that requires someone to get hit by it.
* The idea behind this mechanic is that the party has to rotate getting hit by this, getting hit by this gives you a 3 minute lasting debuff that will kill you if you get hit again.
* If nobody gets hit the attack the boss will wipe the party, so make sure to have 1 person get hit.

* This attack will do either an inner or an outer AoE, this is dependent on the color of the Aura he gets. Look at the picture on the right.

      Aura is Blue = Outer AoE 
      Person taking the debuff should get to the outer circle.

* So the people who need to dodge should get close to the boss.

      Aura is Red = Inner AoE 
      Person taking the debuff should get to the inner circle.

* So the people who need to dodge should get away from the boss.

<h3>Last Boss: Antaroth</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Mana Burst** - After call of 

     “Dispersing collected mana!“

* Antaroth will unleash uniframable room wide attack.
* This attack deal flat damage per stack of Mana Burst on target.
* It also applies a nasty MP reducing debuff which need to be cleansed fast.
     
      Cleanses all stacks of Mana Burst.

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/fO9UEuk.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Red Magic** - Boss charges up his sword and then does a series of 4 attacks:
**1) Thrust** – blockable and iframable, survivable, applies Mana Burst <br>
**2) Spin** – not blockable but iframable, survivable, applies Mana Burst and heavy cleansable bleed <br>
**3) Half circle blast** – uniframable, lethal damage <br>
**4) Series of AOEs** – uniframable, hit for 100% of targets HP, can survive with shields

* **Version 1:** Thrust, clockwise Spin, Half blast on boss’s left, AOEs from in to out

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/2gqaRxG.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

* **Version 2:** Thrust, counter clockwise Spin, Half blast on boss’ right, AOEs from out to in

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/c76shJz.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

* AOEs have unintuitive timing – they deal damage at time they appear, and the lingering animation is harmless.

**Expanding Puddles** - Antaroth summons 5 expanding puddles, which deal high damage with their edges. 
* Iframe towards center of bubbles, or run away. It’s good idea to stand closer to the boss, so no puddle spawns directly on you.

      Not blockable.

**No Escape** - Antaroth calls out : 

     “Escape option disabled.” 

* Then he casts AOEs on every party member. 
* Getting hit by these aoes applies long stun debuff to player hit and creates a small breakable cage around them.

* These aoes are folowed by several medium damage room-wide attaks, which aren’t iframable ! **Tanks can block these attacks and provide 70% damage reduction to nearby party members.**

<center><video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/o0mOZC1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Light and Dark** - With call out : 

     “Enter your final words now.” 

* Boss will teleport to middle of room and start casting room wide wipe attack. 
* 5 orbs get summoned on edges of room, 3 Light and 2 Dark and each player will get a debuff: **2 Light and 3 Dark**.

Players are able to deal damage to opposite color than they have debuff on. Breaking an orb grants a invicibility buff to one nearby player, use this to survive attack he’s casting. <br>
Destroy the orb anywhen runes start to appear on the spell circle.

     The black orb will have a white outlining
     The white orb will have a black outlining

**Attack of the clones** - After calling out : 

     “Patience not found.”
     
Players will get applied slow debuff on them, then boss will teleport in middle of the room, and summon 2 clones. 
* Right after that all 3 will teleport in sequence to outer circle on the floor, and will either use small Spin, or Blue Ball just throw version at random targets. 
* These attacks apply Mana Burst.

      Teleports away from enterance = He will throw Blue Ball
      Teleports to the door = He will Spin

**Cage with shield** - After calling out:

     “Prepare to be deleted.”

* He will cast cage soon after and get a shield. Each player will get one of 3 debuffs: Red, Blue, Yellow. 
* Players must look at their debuff and take slice of same color to refresh their debuff – else they will die after it expires. 

* Boss will also get shield up during this cage, you need to deal enough damage to him down to break it, else he will cast 4th slices and wipe the party.
