Nicknamed **“Dreadspire 3”** this season, this dungeon features multiple floors, each featuring its own challenge. 
* The **first 15 floors** feature various challenges, from BAMs to old Bosses, each featuring its own **unique mechanics** and twists.
* The **last 7 floors** features some of the toughest bosses with their own tweaks.

The top floors of Dreadspire are intended to be the most difficult content of the patch. 
* It is advised to complete gearing before tackling this dungeon. 
* This guide also includes a difficulty rating, with ★ (one star) being the easiest and ★★★★★ (five stars) being the most difficult.


In order to enter the Dreadspire Upper Floors, you will need a **Ticket from the Lower Floors**. 
* This ticket **can only come from the 15th Floor (Kelsaik)** and is tradeable and bankable. Tickets from the previous Seasons do not work.

<h3>General Mechanics</h3>

<h4>Champions of the Dream</h4>

* **Every Floor has a timer.** After the timer ends, Montori will announce: 
 
      "So much for champions of the dream..."
  
And the current challenge will get **much more difficult**, with the boss becoming **permanently enraged** for the rest of the fight. <br>
* Failing to make the timer will not result in a instant wipe.
 * Floor 16 to 19 have a **10 minute timer**. 
 * Floors 21 and 22 have a **15 minute timer**.
 * Floor 20 has **no timer**.
  
<h4>Permanent Buffs</h4>

* Entering the Dreadspire Upper Floors will give your party buffs that increase Power, Defense, and Maximum HP. 
  * These buffs are the same as the ones **given from completing the Mini-Game floors** in the Lower Floors.
<h4>Montori’s Buffs</h4>

* After **destroying the Phantom Crystal**, Montori will give your entire party all buffs, from bravery to food.
* If your party wipes, the boss will respawn in 60 seconds. Your party will receive a boon in 30 seconds. 
  * You will receive consumables shortly after. Your party should charm, rebuff, and get into position within the next 30 seconds.

<div id="f16">
<h3>Floor 16: Hrathgol ★★</h3>

Aside from his usual powerful and swift attacks, Hrathgol will summon flying Argons. These will hone in on the players, then remain stationary whilst firing an energy beam at the ground. Best not be caught daydreaming when this happens!


</div>

<div id="f17">
<h3>Floor 17: Melkatran ★★</h3>

Melkatran has similar attacks to the version you've already seen: parasites you need to shake off by jumping, stunning attacks, or monsters which, once summoned, you either need to kill or leave to reach the boss according to their color.

The difficulty is a notch higher than in Manaya's Core, since the monsters become invisible on their way to Melkatran, meaning that you can't see their color, or the parasites aren't visible on your screen.

<div id="f18">
<h3>Floor 18: Lokmar Sorgalur ★★★</h3>

Overseers patrol the outskirts of the room in the fight against Lokmar Sorgular. If you get too close to them, they summon deadly spheres which follow a player and try to inflict extremely high damage.

In the meantime Volsurus arrives as an overseer, and if he discovers a player, he summons an Argon Priest, who causes high damage in a large radius.
