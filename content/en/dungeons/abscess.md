<h3>PreFight</h3>

Just few mobs on the way when you enter the pathway to the first mobs. Nothing special, kill them and move to the first boss.

<h3>First Boss: Thalweg</h3>

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Slap** - Simple two hit attack.

**Slam** - Simple two hit attack.

**Random Target Laser** - Basically, a **random target will get the purple secondary aggro** circle, the boss will turn to face him, and then he will shoot a beam of laser. 
* The laser is lock on and will follow the target until shot. 
* This move can kill your healers or your sorcs so have them practice timing their iframe carefully.

**Forward Roll / Side Roll** - **"Forward Roll"** always happens after his **eyes light up**. 
* It’s also a great way for the boss to push you against the wall making it easier for you to position him in a way that pleases everyone.

![](https://i.imgur.com/lsJdIir.gif)

The **“Side Roll”** is indicated by him swinging his left hand outwards. 
* Then he will turn sideways and roll. He will often follow this roll by another roll going in the opposite direction. 
* According to some guides on KTera forums, the first roll can also be followed by laser or a forward roll.

**Ground Waves** - The boss will growl while moving his head in a growling motion followed by **4 waves of blue AoE attack all around the boss**.
* Hits stagger and knock you down. Kaiable/iframable.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**I will get stronger** - The boss will growl while moving his head in a growling motion much like what he does during “Growling Waves” attack, except he will have a speech bubble that says :

     I.. I will get stronger!

Now, while getting him get stronger might make this boss much more thriling, it wouldnt make it easier.

So in order to prevent him from getting stronger, you must **stun him before he gets his stack of power buff**. 
* Once you **successfully stun** him, he will flop to the ground. This is neither a timed pattern nor a pattern based on health percentage. 
* In fact, it can even happen consecutively so always be prepared and always be ready.

**Virus adds** - This occurs first when the boss reaches 16 lines of HP. Then it is hypothesized that “Viral Zone” will occur every 2:30 minute after the first. 
* These viruses will spawn as well as a large fiery zone that much resembles hell. 
* You can see a glimpse of it in the “Laser” move gif. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/SCaDU4L.gif)

What you want to do in this situation is you want the **healer to heal aggro the viruses** into this fiery zone of hell where the DPS will help get rid of these viruses. 

**Spider Spawns** - These happens every 2 minute interval of the fight. The boss will finish whatever he was doing and then quickly shuffle his way to the center. 
* Then there will be 4 different mobs that spawn in different corners of this circular room and approach the boss. 
* If the mobs get to the center safely, then the boss will obtain a stack of power buff for every non-killed mob. 

**Bomber Unit** - Once your party brings the boss down to 8 lines of HP, a bomber will spawn every minute. 
* At the same time a random member in your party will get a slow debuff.

<h3>Bridge</h3>

You will meet several mobs spawning along the way, you will **have to kill them** before attacking the miniboss at the end.

Miniboss generally doesnt require much dps, just kill him and move on to the last boss.

*Tip:* You can skip killing the mobs if your party jumps on to the railing on the side of the stairs near the miniboss. The mobs will lose aggro and disappear, allowing you to instantly start fighting the miniboss.

<h3>Last Boss: Krakatox</h3>

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Forward Attack (x2/x4)** - Takes a bone out from his body and swings 2 or 4 times while moving forward.
* **Safe Zone:** Behind his right leg (bony leg)

*Note:* May walk into a virus zone reducing DPS or walk out of the room causing the boss to reset.

**Wide Attack** - Takes a bone out and swings in a wide arc. 
* It hits 315 degrees with a 15m radius. 
* This is the most dangerous attack pattern especially since it is **followed by a laser attack**.
  * **Safe Zone:** Behind his right leg (bony leg)

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Laser** - This move usually comes after the double wide attack. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/jAPpL4c.gif)

This attack has 3 characteristics:
1. Fan shaped attack
2. 2x more damage at ranged players
3. Applies “Democron’s Virus” debuff

![](https://i.imgur.com/LfsA86o.png)

The **Democron’s Virus debuff** from the laser inflicts continuous damage every 2 seconds for 20 seconds.

**Bomb + Ground Stab** - He digs out **1 or 3 bombs** from his belly and throws it away from him. 
* If he throws three bombs, the areas where the explosions intersect will cause double the damage. 
* Furthermore this attack is immediately followed by a **Ground Stab** which is a **melee AoE attack** that will cause players to be knocked down.

![](https://i.imgur.com/oKHdNPU.gif)

The **Ground stab attack hits 15m** around the point where the weapon hits the ground. <br>
If you’re facing the front of the boss, the area of effect will be up to 18m away from the boss.

![](https://i.imgur.com/yQLEaab.gif)

**Bleeding Attack + Ground Stab** - Normally a purple circle without attack animation indicates Bleeding Attack. 
* He will stab the ground with his hand causing a spike to come up inflicting a **"Democron’s Virus"** debuff on the player. 
  * Then he will stab the ground with a bone causing an AoE KD.

**Shield Phase (AKA Democron’s Energy)** - It will begin as the boss stops his attacks and walk towards the center of the room. 
* This is the best opportunity for the DPS to get as much DPS in as possible. 
* **There are three different aspects to this phase.**

1. **The first aspect** is the actual shield. The shield will absorb all damage and needs to be broken within 15 seconds. 
   - **If it is not broken, the party will wipe.**
2. **The second aspect** is the Blue Tentacles that appear during every shield phase. 
   - Your party can decide to break the tentacles or to not break it. Basically, a number of blue tentacles will appear at the beginning of shield phase and if you destroy all the tentacles, you will receive a buff called “Democron’s Cell”. 
   - This buff will protect you from the third aspect AKA the virus zone. 
   - The **first shield phase** (at Line 16) will only have 1 tentacle while the second shield phase and the third will have 3 and 5 tentacles.

![](https://i.imgur.com/s9XBDLP.png)

3. **The third aspect** is the Virus Zone. 
   - Similar to the Virus Zones in Stage 1, a virus zone that does continuous damage per second to all the players inside it. 
   - You may choose to clear the tentacles which will negate all the damage incurred by the virus zone or you may choose to heal spam through the damage and go straight to attacking the boss.

**Democron’s Curse** - Onscreen message will appear indicating the start of Democron’s Curse. The curse will stack every 10 seconds.

![](https://i.imgur.com/1fdpWGx.png)

**Tentacle Prison** - A random player is caught in a tentacle prison which needs to be broken within 18 seconds. 
* If you fail to break the prison within 18 seconds, your entire party will wipe. 
* This pattern is avoidable by evading just before the prison appears. There are several examples in the youtube video above.  
  * Occurse every 40 ~ 45 seconds.

**Charge and Evolution** - Very similar to Shandra Manaya’s “Great Ones lend me your power” pattern. 
* First, an on-screen message will appear saying “Put up with this!” and will start charging. He will **CHARGE for 5 seconds** and if you fail to stop his charge, he will **EVOLVE**. 
  * To stop the charge the **healer needs to use Plague of Exhaustion or Regression** on the boss before he finishes charging.

![](https://i.imgur.com/7rh9Vn7.jpg)

Once he evolves, his attack speed will increase by 10% and power by 100% for 30 seconds.


Once you hit line 4 of his HP bar, the last shield phase will occur (with 5 tentacles) marking the start of stage 4. 
* At this time, your curse debuff will stop stacking and the boss will start getting an **ENRAGE buff**. 
  * It will stack every 5 seconds and increase the boss’s power with every stack. 
  * By the time shield phase is over he will already have 5 stacks. **From around 20 stacks, players will not be able to block any of his attack.** 
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/m9tvd73.jpg) 
  
The trick in Stage 4 is to make sure you do not cleanse the existing Curse debuff to ensure you have enough DPS to clear the boss as fast as possible.
