<h3>Timespheres</h3>
Ball 3 will be shieldless and the other two will be protected with a reflective shield. Dealing damage to a shielded sphere will deal damage to the player equal to 10% of his maximum HP.

     High DPS parties should kill the shielded balls (1+2)
     Then destroy the remaining ball (3).

<h3>First Boss: Hemera</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

     Your tank must bring the boss one of the spheres around the room.
     Position the boss so DPS can hit the boss without hitting sphere.

**Spheres and Shield** - When entering the room, you’ll be faced with Hemera and by default, it is protected by a reflective shield. 
* Players will receive 10% maximum HP as damage when attacking Hemera with an active shield.

This will deal damage to anyone who is mid-range to that person. 

      3. South West (Recommended 2nd)

* This sphere will periodically place the Circle from the mini game onto the person with the highest aggro. <br> 
This will deal damage to anyone who close-range to that person. The person selected will still be damaged.

      4. South East

* This sphere will periodically debuff players with a damage over time and the same Bleed/Sleep effect as the mini game. <br>

**North West / South East spheres** - Spheres will occasionally give Hemera a 5 second buff that will need to be Plagued/Regressed. Failure to remove this buff will give Hemera a substantial power buff for 30 seconds.<br>

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Dive** - From time to time, Hemera will rise up slightly, stagger all nearby players and then slam the ground.

     “We will meet again!”

<h3>Second Boss: Tempas</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

     Tank the boss against the wall or circular motion. 
     However, the tank must be able to get out and avoid the breath.

**Storm Incarnate** - Tempas shouts
     
     “Fools! I am the storm incarnate!“

And then jumps, this causes a shockwave across the field.<br>

* Second or two later after Tempas lands, multiple Kuma Statues will fire lightning bolts at players so be prepared to dodge.

**Tempas’s Statues** - When an Electric Sphere touches a statue, it will activate the statue. The statue will then fire a streak of lightning across the room at the closest player.
* You can also stun or CC the statues.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Electric Spheres** - Spheres will float around the field, usually on the outer edges.
* They can be destroyed but it is not recommended as DPSing the boss would be much faster.

**Jump** - Tempas will jump and slam onto the ground.This will send players into the air if not outright oneshotting you.
* Make sure to iframe.

**Breath** - Tempas will deal an electric breath attack at a player.
*  The breath attack will leave three electric puddles on the ground.

<h3>Final Boss: Valona</h3>
When entering the room, you’ll notice that the floor is split into 3 parts. An Inner Ring, Center Ring and Outer Ring.<br> 
They’ll move around when you first encounter a boss. 

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

* These are the **Sun** tile, **Devil** tile and **Goddess** tile. (Do not be confused by the floating cubes, pay attention to the walls).
* During the fight, one of the walls will light up, the Sun will glow red, the Devil will glow purple and the Goddess will glow green. <br>

Your party must then cooperate and align the floors so that they are facing the appropriate wall.
* All three floor’s alignment pieces must be facing that wall.
* Successfully completing one of these will give your party members a buff that lasts until the timer ticks zero again.

      1) Sun: Regenerates HP over time. Stamina does not decrease.
      2) Goddess: Increases Defense.
      Restores the HP+MP to 100% and allowing dead players to revive.
      3) Devil: Restores 100% MP every 15 seconds.
     
**Rotating and aligning the floors** - During the fight, a wall will glow it’s respective color.
* **Outer Ring** - The outer ring can be rotated by destroying a Time Device on the outer edges of the map.
* Destroying one will rotate the outer floor once in a clockwise motion. **(Devil > Goddess > Sun > Devil)**. <br>
![](https://i.imgur.com/jAX5xVP.png)

Destroying all **3 Time Devices** will announce :  
     
     “The World Seal draws upon the power of the worlds.” 
     
* After five seconds, Yana receives a buff which increases its defense and party members will receive a deadly DoT. 
* Healers should cleanse the party and Plague/Regress Yana.

**Middle Ring** - Yana will shout :

     “Open your mind to all of time and space!”

And proceed with a ring shape explosion on the center ring.

* When a player stands inside this attack, they must take damage and survive, then the middle ring will rotate counter-clockwise **(Sun > Goddess > Devil > Sun)**. 
* In order for players to survive, players must **share the damage by standing in** the damage zone together. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/Gm0EglZ.png)
**Inner Ring** - You’ll notice another bar when fighting Yana.This bar can fill up to 100.
* This bar will fill up when you attack the boss.
* When the bar is full, “A Stone Sigil Becomes Active” will be shown and you will be able to interact with Yana (by pressing “F”).
* This will rotate the inner ring clockwise **(Devil > Goddess > Sun > Devil)**.

<center><h3>Failing this mechanic</h3></center>

**Yana will receive a specific buff depending on which wall is glowing.**<br>
It is not recommended that you fail any and it’ll make the fight harder.

**2) Goddess** <br>
Yana will receive a 30% attack speed buff and 100% increased defense.

* Dodge all the claps to unlock an achievement.

**Dice Attacks** - Yana will use his dice to attack players, combos include smashing them in front and them behind and throwing them at the person with the highest aggro. 

**Spin** - Yana will spin around and proceed to juggle its cubes, spinning them at high speeds around it. 
* This can deal a lot of damage and potentially kill melee players, so it is best to avoid this by escaping.

**Leash** - From time to time, if no players are nearby, Yana will leash a player saying :

       “Come closer, little mote!”

**Ripple** - After 60% HP, Yana will occasionally slam into the ground, releasing 3 consecutive waves.

     “Who are you to touch my statue?”
     
And attempt to mix up the floor.You must interrupt her by **stunning**.<br>
* Failure to do so will cause Yana to slam his dice into the ground, moving either the Outer or Inner Ring once. 

**Black Hole** - Yana will place a black hole on a player and will stay on the ground for a while. 
* Entering this black hole will cause players to be teleported to a Time Device on the outer edges of the field.

      “My power has been gathering in this realm!”
     
* And proceed to eject mass amounts of energy, killing anyone still left inside.
