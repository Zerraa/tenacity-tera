<h3>First Boss: Atrocitas</h3>

     MT The Dream changes:

     - Nothing changed.
     - Pulses his for 35% of total HP.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Red/Blue Explosion** - The boss will occasionally do an area explosion around him that MAY OR MAY NOT change his color.
* In hard mode only this will deal direct damage to all players.
  * You can look at the boss to see what color it is or see the color of its debuff which is below the life bar. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/rkFhwA9.png)

**Red/Blue Debuffs** - A message will appear on the screen 

     "Fear my rage!" 
     
Along with an inner and outer circle that will appear on the ground.

    If the boss's is blue, the inside is blue and the outside is red.
    If the boss's is red, the inside is red and the outside is blue.

Whichever debuff you have, be it Blue or Red , you must take the opposite or else you will die.
* If you fail this mechanic you take 50 million direct damage. - **ONESHOT**

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Back and forth** - The boss will jump back and forth.
* Jumping back won't do much damage if you're hit.
* The forward jump **cannot be blocked** and the hit stuns for 10 seconds, this **stun cannot be cleansed**.
  * If you're a tank, you can just step back and the jump forward won't hit you. Or you can **iframe it** in any way.
* **If someone is stunned by the forward jump attack**, the boss will try to kill this person by stomping.

**Front pushback** - The boss will jump slightly and release a burst of steam from his chest.
* The range of the attack is in the shape of a cone in front of him.
  * It will deal severe damage and knock you back.
* **You cannot block this attack, you must iframe it.** Lancer can also use Challenging Shout to become immune.

**Charge** - The boss randomly targets a player with a purple circle below himself and will start charging in a straight line, killing anyone in the way.
* After this, the boss will do it a second time targeting the tank with higher aggro.

This attack will do damage through block when the boss charges at the tank. **This should prevent the charge if you have low defense**, but you can stop the boss from moving if you block the first hit and then back up to a safe position. 
* If you have a competent healer and good equipment, you have a chance to mitigate all hits without dying. 
* **This is something that tanks will have to try for themselves.**

**Jump** - Randomly target a player with a purple circle below them and the boss just jumps at them.
Afterwards, the boss will jump towards the tank with the highest aggro.

**Shot** - The boss will usually trigger this attack if the aggro starts to alternate between the players.
* The boss will swing back, target a random person and do a furious attack.
  * Avoid him stomping towards you, it is blockable but you will be pushed back.

<h3>Second Boss: Malgarios </h3>

     MT The Dream changes:

     - Spit attack will oneshot most classes.
     - There is now 7 eggs in the room.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Spider baby meter** - A few seconds into the fight, a message will appear in the center of the screen 

     "The baby arachnen targets a new prey!"

A small spider will appear across the room with a **“Spiderling's Hunger”** meter present on your screen.
* Person excluding the tank will be taken by an orb above their head and a debuff letting them know that you are targeted by the spider.
![](https://i.imgur.com/zrRJ43u.png)
The spider will wreak havoc when it catches you, dealing AoE damage and leaving a debuff that slows and leaves you bleeding for 3 seconds.

**If the spider's meter reaches 100, the spider will start scurrying around players while stunning them and trying to kill them.**
* The person with the debuff needs to **lure the spider to one of the nearby eggs** around the room. Just stay close to the egg when the spider is chasing you. Once the spider places its attention on the egg you have succeeded and the spider will go back to sleep for the time being.
![](https://i.imgur.com/05hAd74.png)

**You have a limited number of eggs around the room!**

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Charge** - The boss will turn back before doing this attack and will randomly target a person and make a charge killing anyone on the way.
* The boss can do this attack 3 times in a row.

**Spit** - The boss randomly targets someone with a purple circle under him.
* It will shoot circles in the area where you are, doing very little damage that is not worth avoiding.
  * The boss can do this attack 3 times in a row.

**Stun slam** - This attack goes through the block so iframe it. Also hurts a lot **so make sure to avoid it**

**Stun Trap** - A message will appear in the center of the screen that says :

     "Resurrected Malgarios attracts everyone!"

* The boss won't do anything at this point, but soon **he will receive a 10 second debuff where he will start to be vulnerable to knockdown and stagger**. Succeeding in this prevents the boss from completing his attack.
* If you miss the boss's knockdown/stagger **before the debuff reaches 6 seconds**, the boss will chain everyone pulling them towards him and stun them for a brief moment. After this, he will do an area attack around himself. 
  * Your stun should be gone before he can do that attack and kill your party.

You can jump when he chains you and get knocked down. Priests can use Guardian Sanctuary and Mystic Corruption Rings to prevent being taken over by the chain.

<h3>Last Boss: Lachelith</h3>

As a Tank, avoid taking the curse debuff or you will suffer while tanking her.

     MT The Dream changes:
     
     - Her attack speed is increased by a lot.
     - Her tail attack oneshots.
     - Debuff makes you take 50% more damage.
       - Red skulls hit for 80% HP.
       - White skulls hit for 30% HP.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**IN-OUT or OUT-IN** - Boss will briefly stop and turn her head to one side. Make sure to **pay attention** as it will hint on which kind of AoE she will do with her tail.
* **If the boss turns to his left** with his head facing backwards, stay inside and then go outside.

<center><video controls>

</video></center>

* If the boss reaches 50%, she will always follow up with the tail slam back.

Deals severe damage and a bleed debuff that can be cleared. <br>
You need to be extremely far away to avoid this attack completely if you want to outrange it. 

**Circles into Curse** - A message will appear on your screen which says 

     "It's your fate. Welcome it"

* This mechanic will start when the boss reaches 90% HP and repeats periodically.
  * They will all have a circle below them that will explode a few seconds later. Simply iframe outside the circle when you see it.

If you miss the circle iframe in time, you're going to take 500,000Hp direct damage. **MAKE SURE TO AVOID IT**
* The two closest players will take a 2 minute curse that cannot be cleared. The effects are as follows:
  * You will take 50% more damage from the boss.
  * Soul spheres will do double damage to you.
* Taking this debuff a second time before its duration ends will automatically kill you.

In hard mode, you shouldn't let the tank take this debuff as it reduces his endurance so much that he could be one-shot by a normal attack if he makes a mistake.
You can easily alternate taking this debuff with your party since the mechanic repeats itself roughly over a minute. 
* Player A & B, then player C & D, and again players A & B. (for this it is important that no one is dead)

**Skulls** - The mechanic will start when the boss's health is below 70% HP and repeats periodically. A message on your screen will say, 

     "Lachelith is about to use the soul sphere!"

* **The boss will move to the center of the room and summon 5 soul spheres in all directions.** There are two different types of souls.
* Your party must touch the soul spheres to prevent them from touching the wall. If they end up doing it, everyone will take 30k damage and the soul will be multiplied by two.
1. The red soul deals 80k damage to you. (160k if you have a curse)
2. The yellow soul deals 40k damage to you. (80k if you have a curse)

Make sure those with curse debuff take yellow soul, while if you dont have debuff you take red.
* Lancer can use divine protection so you can collect two skulls at once.

**Helicopter** - The mechanic will start when the boss's health is below 50% and repeats periodically.

The attack starts from **inside, middle and finally outside** - in that order.

* You will take 150,000 Hp direct damage if you are hit by this attack.

**Healers must use plague/regression to remove the buff stack** completely before the boss finishes the attack.

**Explosion** - The mechanic starts when the boss's health is below 30% and repeats periodically.
* Everyone will take damage and be knocked back with a bleed debuff that takes 20% of your maximum health every second for 15 seconds. **It needs to cleanse immediately**.

<center><video controls>

</video></center>

* After the explosion, the boss will target a person with an inescapable trap circle around him, followed by two lasers. 
  * These cannot be iframed and follow the patterns 2-3 and 3-2, these:

![](https://i.imgur.com/S2a46ii.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/rohC8lS.png)

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Right hand first** - The boss will start this attack by hitting the Tank with his **right hand**.<br>
The sequence will always be **“Right hand > Left hand > Right hand”** and then two things can happen **OR** boss can do nothing else and end the sequence. OR : 
* He can do a forward swipe that will push you back and apply a bleed buff that can be cleansed. **The speed of the swipe will depend on whether it is engaged or not.** 
  * If he is not enraged, the swipe will be slower, taking 1 second after the last attack, while if he is enraged it will be instant.

<center><video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/jagHAcN.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

It is recommended that when in doubt as to whether you are going to do the frontal swipe, iframe the same, since when this enrrage is very fast, and apart from that the high ping does not help.
* If someone dies from this attack the boss will randomly target someone with a laser and the message **"The friend you trust is long gone."**

**Left hand first** - The boss will attack the tank starting with his **left hand**. <br>
The sequence will always be: **left hand > right hand > back tail > front laser**.

<center><video controls>

</video></center>

The back tail attack cannot be framed and does massive damage. It will also give a bleeding debuff if you are hit, this debuff can be cleared. DPS can be diagonally behind the boss and will not be hit by this attack.
* **It only does a laser in front of the tank which cannot be iframed.**
  * The laser pattern is always the same so it's easy to dodge.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Front Scythe Stab** - She grabs her scythe-like tail and slams down in front of her dealing massive damage and a bleed debuff that can be cleared.
**This attack cannot be iframed, you should move out of its way before it hits you.**

<center><video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/dyJqWhu.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

* **If she pauses while her scythe is down**, she will do a **big arc attack behind her** where you should block or iframe. 
  * The safe spot is in front of her in a small cone shape. 
  * You can avoid this completely if you are too far away from her.

She can target this attack to any player in the party with random aggro (also known as a purple circle under you).

**Ressbait laser** - The boss will done a ressbait laser when your healer or anyone uses ress-skill, starting with message:

     Now, You belong to me!

And fires a sequence of 3-2 lasers on the person. These lasers cannot be framed. The pattern is always this:
![](https://i.imgur.com/iVBLu6M.png)

* **If you receive a ress and the healer get targetted DO NOT immidiately ress up.**
  * But usually the laser will hit you before you finish casting the ress. So cancel the ress, dodge the lasers, and ress again.
