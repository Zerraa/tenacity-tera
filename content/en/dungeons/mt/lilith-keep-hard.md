## First Boss: Pyrepelt
### Key Mechanics

<center>

![](https://i.imgur.com/dWOIAjj.png)

</center>

**Leap** - Shortly after you see this message:  

{{< alert context="info" >}}
“How annoying… I will kill you all!!“
{{< /alert >}}

<br> 

Pyrepelt will leap into the air. Upon impact, the entire area except for a narrow strip will be covered in a raging fire.

**Fire Curtain** - Message appears at certain intervals once Pyrepelt has lost sufficient health, and is followed by a series of multiple attacks:

{{< alert context="info" >}}
“The flame will swallow you whole!!!“
{{< /alert >}}

<br> 

Firstly, the boss heads to the edge of the area and runs a complete lap, spreading his ‘fire curtain’ as a message explains. 
* Shortly after this, a **series of flaming spirits will appear** which must be killed as quickly as possible, otherwise they will become more powerful, as another message informs you.

![](https://i.imgur.com/qq4XtOo.png)

Given that Pyrepelt is somewhat preoccupied with spreading his curtain of flames, your group is free to concentrate on the spirits. If you don’t manage to kill them all before Pyrepelt completes his lap, the following will happen:

{{< alert context="warning" >}}
* **The spirits will become more powerful and more difficult to defeat.**
  * **The arena will be encircled by the ring of fire**, greatly reducing the amount of space to move about in.
  * If you step into the burning zone, you’ll receive the debuff Burning Wounds.
* **This cannot be cleansed, lasts for 10 seconds, and stacks if you stay within the burning zone.**
  * Each stack reduces your movement speed by 10% and reducing 5% HP every 2 seconds.
{{< /alert >}}

<br>

* **Failing in the first phase will only marginally reduce the size of the area**, but you can’t afford to fail a second time, or the fight will become hotter than you can stand!

### Special attacks

**The flame will turn you into ash!!** - When this message appears, Pyrepelt will make for one of the players, summoning a circle under their feet which will remain in the arena for some time. 
  * **If a player enters this area, a bomb will appear above their heads.** 
* **The Burning Flamedebuff** which results must be removed within a few seconds, otherwise the bomb will explode and deal major damage to the affected player, as well as anyone else within range.

## Second Boss: Arachandlebra

Arachandelbra is best tanked from room borders, circle around it in concentric circles, towards center, as the floor is more and more covered by spiderwebs

### Key Mechanics

**Wax Counter** - Mechanic starts when this message appears:

{{< alert context="info" >}}
“Now you're trapped!“
{{< /alert >}}

<br>

<center>

![](https://i.imgur.com/fkoyaE5.jpg) 

</center>

Right after that, when meter hits 99/100 - Get away from the boss, as he will release a huge wax AoE to lock you in place when the meter hits 100/100. 
* Healer should be ready to cleanse people still inside the AoE so they can iframe.
  * Dps and Tank should try to be close to each other so that heal can cleanse everyone.

### Basic attacks

**Following circle** - One player is targetted by a circle. Evade fast, or iframe when then moving circle inside the static AoE circle reached the borders of the static circle.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jXvGGEM.png)

Circle stays on the ground for a while so **its recommended to place these away from the boss without spreading them too much**

![](https://i.imgur.com/spMvE3R.png)

**Front poison** - The poisonous gas cannot be blocked! Make sure to iframe when boss tilts back as if hes inhaling.

![](https://i.imgur.com/YxtIppE.png)

**Roll** - Basic roll attack of spider BAM

**Jump** - Basic attack of spider BAM

**Front multi hit** - Basic attack of spider BAM

Her basic attacks deal the following debuffs: <br>
* **Hot Wax Drippings**<br>
Hot wax drippings stick to your body, reducing 2.6% of max HP every 3 seconds. 
* **Bleeding**<br>
Bleeding reduces your movement speed by 50% and reduces 6% of max HP every 2 seconds.

### Special attacks

**Dance** - Boss will hit a big donut shaped AoE around it, then jump and hit the circle inside the donut. 
* **Close range DPS should get safe inside circle then outside or iframe. Long range just get away from whole donut.**

## Last Boss: Lilith

{{< alert context="info" icon="Tip:" >}}
Make sure to lower your sound settings if you play without headphones.
{{< /alert >}}

### Key Mechanics

**Annihilate** - You remember Fulminar, Bathysmal Rise last boss? this is his legacy, but easier. In normal mode, you will not die from not achieving reaching Lilith close range. She will do a dance pattern followed with pizza slices AoE style.

**Purple balls** - With message:

{{< alert context="info" >}}
"How about something big and beautiful..." <br>
Lilith casts a huge attack! Retreat to safety zone!
{{< /alert >}}

  </tr>
</table>

</center>

Get away from Lilith as fast as possible to be able to secure your way out of the balls's way. 
* **When the balls arrive at the edge of the room, the will be circle AoE in the room, one in center, rest around the ball's paths.**
  * It does not deal a lot of damage but can kill you if you were already low life from balls.<br>
  * HM: DOES deal a lot of damage so **be sure to iframe or be far enough to evade**

**Magic Wave into Shield** - With message:

{{< alert context="info" >}}
"Lilith acts suspiciously"<br>
Lilith casts a huge attack! Retreat to safety zone!
{{< /alert >}}

<br>

* Lilith runs towards canter they there is the previously quoted warning. A purple wave starts from the borders of the room: iframe (when around 1/3 of the way to boss is reached by the wave: still needs to go 2/3) then break the shield.
* **The players who did not evade are stunned and thus cannot help to break the shield...**

**The player farthest to boss will get chained, then dragged to boss.**
1. You can: choose who will we locked (thus cannot attack). Heal can pull out a player. **Mystic can evade that with corruption ring.** <br>
2. **HM:** you will have to break the shield around Lilith while fighting on a tick-damage AOE.
  * A ranged dps and highly mobile ones (ninja/slayer) will do they job surely. If you dont have such dpses, healer MUST evade the attack to be able to heal the team through the attack.

**Pushback** - When this message appears: 

{{< alert context="info" >}}

  </tr>

</center>

* **This is immediately followed by a large-scale attack.** The only place you can find protection from this is in a small ring directly around the boss, but reaching the ring in time will be more difficult than it sounds, as **your movement speed has been reduced by 50%**.

<center>

</center>

**Now… it’s time to fall asleep…** - While everyone tries to rescue themselves and reach the safety of the ring, your **healers will have an extra task to perform**. 
* At the same time as the area attacks appear, you’ll receive the **debuff Hypnosis Preparation**, which must be **cleansed** as quickly as possible.
* If you fail to do this, after a few seconds a small sphere of glimmering white light will appear around Lilith together with the message 

{{< alert context="info" >}}
"Now... it’s time to fall asleep..."
{{< /alert >}}

<br>

**The room will fill with Oneiric Mote which puts you into a deep sleep for 15 seconds, during which time you can neither move nor use any skills.**

**Hey! Where do you think you’re going?** - This attack starts with a small, purple field around Lilith. She hammers her scythe into the ground and summons multiple areas of dark energy which flare up and deal damage!
  * If you’re hit by one or more of these fields, you’ll receive the debuff Weakening Will:

      * **Weakening Will**<br>
Your tolerance against Lilith’s Delusion gradually weakens.
    * **Delusion**<br>
Arises when you receive 5 stacks of Weakening Will.<br>
You are enticed by Lilith’s charm. You cannot do anything.
