<h3>First Boss: Pyrepelt</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**How annoying... I will kill you all!!** - Shortly after you see this message, Pyrepelt will leap into the air. Upon impact, the entire area except for a narrow strip will be covered in a raging fire. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/dWOIAjj.png)

**The flame will swallow you whole!!!** - This message appears at certain intervals once Pyrepelt has lost sufficient health, and is followed by a series of multiple attacks.
* Firstly, the boss heads to the edge of the area and runs a complete lap, spreading his ‘fire curtain’ as a message explains. 
* Shortly after this, a **series of flaming spirits will appear** which must be killed as quickly as possible, otherwise they will become more powerful, as another message informs you.

Given that Pyrepelt is somewhat preoccupied with spreading his curtain of flames, your group is free to concentrate on the spirits. If you don’t manage to kill them all before Pyrepelt completes his lap, the following will happen:

* **The spirits will become more powerful and more difficult to defeat.**
  * **The arena will be encircled by the ring of fire**, greatly reducing the amount of space to move about in.
  * If you step into the burning zone, you’ll receive the debuff Burning Wounds .
* **This cannot be cleansed, lasts for 10 seconds, and stacks if you stay within the burning zone.**
  * Each stack reduces your movement speed by 10% and reducing 5% HP every 2 seconds.

* **Failing in the first phase will only marginally reduce the size of the area**, but you can’t afford to fail a second time, or the fight will become hotter than you can stand!

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**The flame will turn you into ash!!** - When this message appears, Pyrepelt will make for one of the players, summoning a circle under their feet which will remain in the arena for some time. 
  * **If a player enters this area, a bomb will appear above their heads.** 
* **The Burning Flamedebuff** which results must be removed within a few seconds, otherwise the bomb will explode and deal major damage to the affected player, as well as anyone else within range.

<h3>Second Boss: Arachandlebra</h3>

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Wax counter** - With message:

      Now you're trapped!

![](https://i.imgur.com/fkoyaE5.jpg) 

When meter hits 99/100 - Get away from the boss, as he will release a huge wax AoE to lock you in place when the meter hits 100/100. 
* Healer should be ready to cleanse people still inside the AoE so they can iframe.
  * Dps and Tank should try to be close to each other so that heal can cleanse everyone.

     "Lilith acts suspiciously"
     Lilith casts a huge attack! Retreat to safety zone!

      Now... it’s time to fall asleep...
