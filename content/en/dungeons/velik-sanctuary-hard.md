<h3>First Boss: Revived Darkan</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Mana Generators** - When the ring of fire appears, you will also notice the Lesser Magic Generators. <br> 
However, if Darkan’s HP falls below 50%, the Lesser Generators will be replaced by Greater Generators and Ring of Fire will reset. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/vjtdPI9.png)

**Annihilation** - Break the pylons with this attack so that it creates a safe zone for next attack.
* **Above 50% HP – Prepare to suffer!** – One person will be targeted for massive damage.
* **Below 50% HP – If you stand together, you can die together!** – Everyone will be targeted for massive damage. <br>
Make sure you break the generator so you have space to dodge Darkan's Dust mechanic.
Once these pylons are destroyed, they will reappear few moments after Darkan nukes the inner area with Dust.
![](https://i.imgur.com/kysBjgm.png)

      One shot if failed to dodge.
      Cannot be blocked, but can be iframed.

* **Lesser Pylon** = Requires 1 person to break it
* **Greater Pylon** = Requires 4 or more people to break it
* **Invincible Pylon** = Invincible. It will have a blue shield. <br>


**Dust** - He will cover almost entire area with a one-shot AoE.
* If you and/or your party successfully broke pylons from Annihilation Mechanic, there will be a safe zone to avoid this massive AoE attack. 
* However, in case the party failed, you can attempt to time your iframe/movement skills to move into the fire then quickly move out of it after Darkan blasts the area.

      One-shot. (does 1,000,000 damage)
      Cannot be avoided.

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Left or Right Slam** - He will attack the person with primary aggro with his Left or Right sword. <br>
**Swipe** - This can also be Left or Right. He will strike down his glowing sword toward the person with aggro while lifting the other hand and pause briefly. <br>
* At this moment you have to look at his pose to determine which side is safe before he swipes a 180º attack that inflicts heavy damage, bleed debuff, as well as pushing you away. 
* To safely avoid this attack, you simply move to the side where his blade is down or use a iframe ability (roll, backstep, etc)

      Heavy Damage

**Back Spin** -  Darkan will swipe his back as he spin around, inflicting Bleed debuff. 

      Inflicts Bleed Debuff
      
**Eviscerate** - Darkan’s 2-hit combo. He will quickly strike down his glowing swords that shoot a blast wave, then immediately follow up with another blast wave. 

      Inflicts Bleed Debuff,
      Heavy Damage

**Drill** - He will charge toward the person with aggro like a drill, hitting multiple times if you don’t avoid it. 
* DPS should be careful behind him as his wings will deal damage if they are too close. 
* This can be forced to trigger when the person with aggro is far away.
**Claw** - This can be either Random target or Res bait. He will face the target and throw his swords, creating a huge claw mark on the floor. 
* His sword inflicts Bleed debuff,while the claws on the floor are DoT (Damage over Time) until they disappear.

      Swords inflict Bleed Debuff
      Claw marks are DoT
      Cannot be blocked.
      
<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Triple Swipe** - He will Swipe three times as he shouts

      “Fools, all of you!”
      “You’ll die here!”
      “I AM INVINCIBLE!”

* There is no static order of his swipes as they are completely random.

      Heavy Damage
      Inflicts Bleed Debuff
      Very Dangerous

**Away with you!** - He will swipe toward the person with aggro, then fly up to put down AoE (Area of Effect) attack in either order: <br>
1) Donut – Circle <br>
2) Circle – Donut <br>
* It is strongly advised to stand around ~7m away from Darkan during this attack.
![](https://i.imgur.com/UpSeuH1.png)

**Dark Heart** - Darkan will glow purple, stab his swords on the ground ,curl up, then roar, blasting a wave that inflicts damage, silence and bleed debuffs.
* Healers should try to prepare their cleanse just incase. 

      Inflicts Silence and Bleed Debuffs
      Silence can be blocked with blue shield.

<h3>Second Boss: Revived Dakuryon</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Pizza Slices** - Dakuryon will run to the center of the map and shout

      “I call upon the power of dark mana!”

After a short while, pizza slices will flash around the map. **Stand on the blank slice!** its the safe spot.
**Multiple AoE Patterns** - Dakuryon will run to the center of map and shout 

      “Dark mana explosion!!”

In few moments, there will be multiple AoE placed around the map.
![](https://i.imgur.com/hwC70mU.png)
**Mobs** - He will summon mobs around the map as he swings around his spear. If you don’t kill these mobs, they will turn into Cursed Archdevans that shoot red balls intermittently, so eliminate them.<br>
**Cage** - During cage, instead of dodging the orange patterns immediately, **just focus on memorizing them first**; it won’t harm you at all. 
* However, as soon as the 5th pattern ends, the purple pattern will appear in the exact same order as the orange pattern, and this is the one that kills you.
* **Debuff in Cage** - You will also see small red skull debuff on your buff bar, with small number indicating how many stacks you have.<br>
If you have these stacks of curse, you **MUST TAKE HIT** from the patterns.
![](https://i.imgur.com/LWSSPLR.png)

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Stab, Wave and Donut** - When your party enters, Dakuryon will lunge his spear toward the first person that enters the combat zone, launch a wave that flies in straight path, then proceed to place a donut AoE.
**Stab and Toss** - He will randomly target (usually someone who has a stack), stab, and throw that target across the room.
**Left or Right** - His most basic attack will be a simple swinging motion with his spear to strike down toward the person with aggro.

      The Swipes will push you away and inflict a bleed debuff.
      The Slams inflict heavy damage.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Purple Balls** - After he reaches certain amount of HP, purple balls as shown below begin to appear in the map.
* When you come in contact with these balls, they will inflict flat damage after few seconds.
* **When there are 4 of these balls floating around**, Dakuryon will says **“BOOM!”**. Then, these balls will create a yellow AoE around 15m radius, and detonate.

      Explosion can be iframed.

![](https://i.imgur.com/lIxnWDd.gif)
**Stack Debuff** - Dakuryon strikes down his spear on the ground twice, which has a vacuum (pull) effect on the first hit. 
* The target debuff does nothing when a party member only takes it once, but when taken twice, they will be stunned and Imperator will leap towards him/her, stab and smash on the ground multiple times before throwing toward the farthest party member. 

      2 Debuff Stacks mean death
      Target throw can be iframed if timed correctly
      Followup AoE can be iframed

* Priest can save the targeted person if they time their Divine Intervention correctly, just before the person gets stunned.

**Double Circle AoE** - 
**Lakan’s Authority** - This is the same as gathering energy buff he gets in Shadow Sanguinary, increasing his Power and Attack Speed.
**Shield Phase** - When his HP falls below a certain amount, the person with the aggro must run as far away from Imperator as possible. The targeted person will have an eye above their head as shown in image on right (bad quality but you can see the eye mark).
* That person will be stunned, and Dakuryon will run toward him/her while having a shield. If the party **fails to break the shield**, Imperator will stab the stunned person and throw him/her to the farthest person. 
* If **succeeding in breaking the shield**, Dakuryon won’t do anything after he reaches his target.

<h3>Pathway – Mutated Perimos</h3>

Here, you can choose to either **(A)** fight Perimos along with a few Archdevan mobs, or **(B)** fight many Archdevan mobs while skipping Perimos. 
* For Hard Mode, option (B) will be much quicker.<br>

* **Option A** - Pay attention when you’re fighting against Perimos. There aren’t much notable attack patterns as they aren’t much of a threat, so just try to defeat him as you’d normally do.<br>
After you defeat Perimos, he will say one of the following lines:

      1) Thank you… for this release…
      2) Beware the… red lightning…
      3) Beware the mark… of Lakan…

These lines will help you figure out Key Mechanics for the next boss: Lakan. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/FvJEcPA.png)

* **Option B** - Going this path will allow you to skip fighting Perimos, and instead fight a handful of Archdevan mobs. Clear these, and then there will be more mobs at the top of a staircase. Clearing all these mobs here will summon a teleportal that leads to the Final Boss.

<h3>Last Boss: Lakan</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

<center>
<table>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
         <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u9BeHx2.png"></td>
         <td>Targets two nearest party members with a debuff.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/hYy5tWw.png"></td>
         <td>After few seconds, everyone will receive a 3 second stun.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td><img src="https://i.imgur.com/H7nEdBb.png"></td>
         <td>After few seconds, everyone will have a bomb on their head with 4 second debuff. </td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>
</center>

* **Debuff** - Players with this debuff will have an eye floating above them, and they will also bleed 3% of max HP every second. This debuff lasts 4 minutes, and if you get this debuff twice, you will die.
* **Spread** - While stunned, a large circle will form around each player, which inflicts 50k damage each, so make sure to spread out. 
* **Gather** - Everyone must gather up quickly as those bombs will explode in a donut AoE around them. Players must gather fast and healers must cleanse immediately, or else anyone not cleansed will detonate and cause a massive AoE damage. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/dBviVMe.png)
After 40 seconds of combat, Lakan will float and say: 

      “I mark you!”
      
He will do this mechanic every 1 minute unless he says **“I am no mere mortal foe!”**

<h4>Pattern Reversal (<50% HP)</h4>
When Lakan’s HP falls below 50%, a system message will appear again, but the order of the Chaos Mechanic pattern will now be **REVERSED**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gDt78d7.png)
* Note: Keep in mind that this message will be randomized!

<h4>FEEL THE ICY TOUCH OF MY EMPTY SOUL… (<30% HP)</h4>

![](https://i.imgur.com/W0rIwNv.png)
Randomly under 90% , he will float in air and say 
      
      “Feel the icy touch of my empty soul!” 
      
There will be a ring closing in toward Lakan, which inflicts deadly damage.**Iframe it.**
* DO NOT go near him after avoiding the ring.
![](https://i.imgur.com/FBIb13r.png)

* When this 5 second buff timer icon (see image on right) appears, healers must use their dispell skill to prevent Lakan from creating a shield. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/qU7q67j.png)

<h4>LAKAN’S SOUL WORLD</h4>

![](https://i.imgur.com/bXqMvRS.png)
When Lakan’s **HP falls below 30%**, you will notice that Lakan is now silvery, and the arena has turned blue.

* All Chaos mechanics will be the inverse.
![](https://i.imgur.com/WlPa1WL.png)

<h4>Soul Saturation Gauge</h4>
Whenever Lakan initiates Soul World, this gauge will **fill up by 20** each time.
<h4>UNDO the Soul World</h4>
Lakan will also UNDO soul world with the quote: **“Ha! Not bad!”** This time, you must **SLEEP** (not plague/regress) Lakan.

<center><h3>Basic attacks</h3></center>

**Sword (chop) – Shield (smash) – Sword (R swing) – Back Spin (cone) – Sword (thrust)** - 
* On the third part when he swings his sword from right to left, he will pause very briefly before he backspins like Darkan, but this time, there will be a large cone attack.<br>

**Sword (chop) – Shield (smash) – Sword (L cross) – Shield (stun) – Back Kick (cone)** -  
* On the third part, he will swing his sword to form an X shape starting with Left diagonal slash then Right. 
* Then he will lift his shield and slam it upright on the ground, creating small AoE that stuns anyone near him, then he will immediately follow up with a back kick that covers large cone AoE behind him.<br>

**Shield (smash) – Sword (chop) – Sword (R cross) – Shield (cone)** - 
* On the third part, he will swing his sword to form an X shape starting with Right diagonal slash then Left.
* Cone on last hit with Shield will cause 5 wave AoE, starting with 10m radius circle, then 10~20m donut, 20~30 donut, 30~40 donut and 40~50 donut. 

**Shield Rally – Sword (R cross)x3 – Sword (stabs)** -  When he strikes his shield it does nothing, but it tells you that he will start slashing like a maniac.

**Random Target Claw Patterns** - The claw attack itself is a 2 hit attack. Lakan will charge energy into his sword and then throw it, splits into 3, leaving a claw mark on the ground, then he will retrieve it after a moment. 
* **Stop – Face random target – Claw** <br>
He just pauses shortly and turns around to face random target.<br>
This occurs mostly due to res bait.
* **Backswing Turn – Face random target – Claw** <br>
He makes a large swing as he turns around, then faces toward random target. <br>
To add, this tends to target farthest person who is within ~17m radius.
* **Shield (Slam) – Laser (from his shield) – Backswing Turn – Face random target – Claw** <br>
His shield glows pink and attacks by thrusting his shield forward. He will pause briefly as the shield’s glow is concentrated and shoots a laser. 

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Double 5-way shot** - He will curl up with a small puddle under him, then launch 5-way projectile around him

      “You cannot defend against me.”

![](https://i.imgur.com/9TGCa1G.png)
* There are several ways to trigger this:

      1) Person with aggro dies
      2) Person with aggro is too far away (~8m?)
      3) Person with aggro loses aggro
      3) When he does or undoes soul realm

* Healers can prevent this with res bait.

**Circle or Donut** - A quote will pop up in the middle of the screen:
 
      “Begone!”
 
With a large sword swing motion, he will spin around with either Red or Purple swipe surrounding him. 
* **Purple swipe** - He will place a Circle AoE (~8m); **stay away** from him.
![](http://i.imgur.com/48DsRtA.gif)  
* **Orange swipe** - He will place Donut AoE (8m~20m?); **hug** him.
