<h3>First Boss: Vera & Prima</h3>

- Vera is an Archdevan Lancer and Prima is an Archdevan Sorcerer. Players only need to take care of one of the two, usually the Lancer. 
- The other will disappear if one of them dies.

- Prima can be CC’d (Stun, Sleep, Fear, etc). Let a DPS pull the Sorcerer away in the beginning and put CC on her with classes with lots of CC like Warrior, Berserker, Healers, etc. **Then burn Vera as much as possible.**
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Noxious Fumes** - Vera places Puddles that are (~10m?) wide and **do not disappear**. Tanks will want careful placement and positioning.
* In Hard Mode, puddles apply **“Catastrophe”** debuff that reduces your endurance. 
  * The **“Catastrophe”** debuff **cannot be cleansed**, lasts 1 min until it re-stacks, and stacks up to X times. Puddle size increases as the fight continues.
* You can stun the Lancer to prevent it from placing puddle.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Rally** - The Lancer Vera will call out to Prima during the fight. 
* The message **“Vera requests aid from Prima!”** appears and Prima will come to Vera’s aid and blow you away with large AoE push. 
  * Players can stun Vera immediately when he calls out to prevent this mechanic. This can happen the other way around as well, with the Prima calling out to Vera.

**Acid** - Prima will create a large red circle around itself (~15m?) that will blow you away, messing up your rotation or skill cast/charging.
* AoE also applies **“Nauseated”** Debuff that must be **cleansed within 5 seconds** to avoid being Stunned with “Nausea” Debuff which cannot be cleansed.

**Prima Attacks** - Prima can cast Painful Trap, Arcane Pulse, Fireball, Fireblast, and Flame Pillar.

<h3>Second Boss: Odon</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Carpet** - It starts to put a carpet starting at 90% and it will have a wave motion 3 times until AoE Explodes. 
* It repeats 3 times.
  * Carpets will be more rampant as fight goes on.

This pattern repeats every 20%. (90%, 70%, 50%, 30%, 10%)<br>
The last carpet (at 10%) will appear 4 times. 
* When hit by the carpet AoE, players will receive a DoT debuff, ticking off 10k HP every 2 second for 30 seconds. **This debuff stacks up to 3 times.**
* If all players successfully evade all carpets, Odon will spin in place, saying **“What? Did everyone… make it out?”** and becomes vulnerable.

**During the carpet phase**, the boss receives a **“Diamond Armor”** buff, which increases his defense exponentially and prevents him from taking damage. 
* This buff lasts for 30 seconds, though the shield often runs out before the timer ends.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Odonitos** - Eventually mobs will summon during the battle.Warned by : 
 
     “To me, my minions!”
     
Their attacks and the small puddle it leaves behind will inflict slow debuff. It would be a problem when it comes to evading carpet, mainly for tanks.

**Toxic Release** - Odon curls itself and release poison from its behind.Also stuns when you get hit.
![](https://i.imgur.com/kYbbbxz.jpg)
- Odon jumps into the air and lands in an AoE that deals damage. Getting hit applies Bleeding, which decreases movement speed and deals damage over time. 
  - Getting hit by this will apply Excessive Bleeding instead, which decreases movement speed and deals severe damage over time.

- Odon raises his front claws into the airs and then slams them down in a frontal AoE.

<h3>Last Boss: Verno</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

- There must be someone attacking in the front at all times, or else Verno gains buffs. so if the tank dies, someone else must attack from the front or else he gets **“Hardened Bark”** which increases Defense by 20% per stack and **“Electrified Sap”** which increase Defense and Power by 20% per stack for a few minutes. 
  - He also gains **“Unpredictable Rage”** for 10 seconds that will reflect a portion of received damage to the attacker.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**4-Way Pizza Bomb** - During the fight you will see green gas markers appear around Verno where green gas starts to form in 4 directions, blasting a wave of poison.

**Lasers** - Lasers, similar to Meldita’s laser but double. Evade to the side using iframes.
* Lasers starts at 90% and recur **every 20%** warned with :

     “I will kill you all!“

* These Lasers will spin 2~3 times either Clockwise OR Counter-clockwise randomly. 
  * It is a guaranteed oneshot in Hard Mode and moves faster.

**Circle/Donut AoE** - There will be orange AoE indicator before minor damage occurs in an AoE. 
* Simply stay away/evade it. Two wave motion on AoE seems to be indication of iframe (on the timing of third wave).
![](https://i.imgur.com/ISDj4IL.jpg)

**Pushback** - With the message “Get Out!“, Verno starts to gather up green gas around it, shine a red light and let out strong winds. 
* There are two faces on his front and backside that will flash red before the attack. 
* Failure to evade this will push you back. I-frame after you see faces flash.

**Shockwave** - Starting 50% and below, it will slam its hands on the ground, creating a red shockwave.
* Evade using iframe toward Verno.

      “You will all burn!” = Shockwave Outward
      “Burn!” = Shockwave Inward

**Mobs** - Around **10%~30%**, Blood Sprouts will appear once with the message : 

     “From the ashes, new life!“.

Mobs will inflict **“Chaos”** in an AoE (the circle in which they apply Chaos is larger than the visible area) which will reverse your movement controls. 
* Killing the mobs will drop an **"Inversion Mote"** which gives increased movement speed, drastically reduced damage, and grants immunity to debuffs for 30 seconds, though it won’t remove any existing debuffs.

**Multi-puddles** - With the message :

     “Did you really think this would be easy?“
     
He will spread 6 to 8 AoE pizza slices around him, which will apply **“Doomed Hero”** when hit. 
* This debuff will place an AoE under you which will explode and damage anyone within it after 5 seconds. **This debuff can be cleansed.**
