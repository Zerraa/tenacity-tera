<h3>First Boss: Yativio</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Minions** - Minons will spawn with the message : 

     "Yativio spawned minios to shield itself!"

* When Yativio's HP bar reaches **x27 x22 x10 and x3 (~90%, ~70%, ~30Â°, ~10%)** the boss spawns a group of miniplants which have to be killed ASAP. 
  * If they are not eliminated within a few seconds, each (remaining) plant will give Yativio a +1% power buff. 
  * **When the miniplants say "We're killer buds!"** their debuff has already been added to the boss. If the plants arent destroyed fast enough, the next attack pattern is automatically triggered.

**Devastating AoE** - The power of the recieved buffs will now unleash. 
* Yativio turns to red just before this attack. Few seconds later, painfull waves will deal damage in a huge circle AoE. 
* **This attack can kill anyone without a heavy armor.** 
  * This attack hits multiple times so a simple evasive roll/backstep/evasive smash/shadow step may not be enough.

**Suicide Bombers are back!** - A random player in your party will be targeted and followed by a group of suicide bombers. Two ways to deal with the situation:
1. If its the first run for your party or you are wearing a cloth armor, let the mobs catch you to leave the AoE and the mobs there far away from your party.
2. If you have a more experienced party, you can try leading the bombers to Yativio as they deal damage to the boss too.

When Yativio's HP reaches x9 (30%), it gets a permanent buff that increases its power by 68% and attack speed by 50%.
* **At x4 (~10%) HP a big group of minions spawns again.** They are too many to kill all of them, focus on burning down the boss to x0 instead.

**Stun and Spin** - The title says everything: Yativio stuns and gives a poison debuff to the nearby enemies, then spins dealing damage continuously.

<h3>Second Boss: Vesporax</h3>

Vesporax gets a buff that increases its power by 68% and attack speed by 50% when reaches x9 (30%) HP.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Poison Circles** Starting with the message : 

     "Vesporax sprays the cave with acid!"

* Vesporax walks into the middle of the room, few seconds later a group of huge AoE circles appear that deal quite high damage. 
  * **Try to get out of them asap, as the whole room will be affected by the poison.**

**There is a spot in the room (north west side of the "room")** where the AoEs can never reach.

<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Bees** - Vesporax spawns bees announcing: 
   
     "Vesporax is summoning bees"

* These arent the bees you just chase out of the window in the kitchen, they deal quite high damage, however they can be killed by 2 or 3 players, so nothing really to worry about.

<h3>Last Boss: Koleogg</h3>

**Koleogg has a 15min timer.** If its not killed before the time is up, it recieves a buff that increases its power by 1000% and attack speed by 400%. You dont want that.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Shield Phase** - 
* As you start the fight, its very likely that you face a "shield phase" soon. 
* **There are 3 types of shields**, each requires different actions to avoid. Check the shield icon under Koleogg's HP bar to decide which type of shield it has.
  * If it is a 30sec shield, **the healers should remove it (priests with Plague of Exhaustion, mystics with Regression)**. Koleogg has now lower resistance to knock down and stagger, your party should try to interrupt his charging for the next attack. 
  
* If you fail to remove the shield and knock down, a **3-AoE attack comes**. 
This attacks hits in three circles with Koleogg in the center. 
1. The first circle is quite little, hits just around the boss. 
2. The second circle (that follows the first one a few seconds later) hits nearly in the whole room, leaving only a narrow place for the players to avoid it at the edge of the platform. 
3. The third circle doesnt have orange marker as it hits in the whole room. 
   - Each hit can take 50-80% of your HP (it can be 100% when Koleogg is enraged or if you dont have at least the gear from normal mode on +9). 

* If its a 60sec shield, **crystal phase is coming**.

**Crystal Phase** - In this phase there will be 3 crystals summoned (see the image above). All of them will need to be destroyed for the wall to appear and save you from the onehitter.
* **Crystal phase happens at x24 x15 x6 (80% 50% and 20%) HP.** 
  * At the first one, there will be one set of crystals to destroy, two at the second, and three at the third crystal phase.

* If its a permanent shield:
  * If Koleogg has a permanent shield, your party will have to DPS it down as soon its possible.
  * You dont have much time for it, only about 10 seconds. If you fail to break the shield, you will be dealt a huge amount of damage and will be thrown to the ground.
* On the top of that you will get a bleeding debuff which will kill you if not cleansed fast enough.
  * Priest(s) should use Kaia's shield, as you are immune to being knocked down while in effect. 
  
<center><h3>Special attacks</h3></center>

**Noxious Gas** - I this attack Koleogg turns around and blown noxious gas from its back.

**Noxious Gas II** - Koleogg flies up and blows noxious gasses in a circle on the ground. This attack has a second hit (that deals damage in a line) when the boss lands. 
* If you get hit by the gas, you recieve a debuff that decreases your movement speed by 80% and loose 2% of your total HP. 
  * The effect can be removed simply by jumping.
