<h3>First Boss: Theropath</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Pull AoE** - The boss will pull everyone towards him and then put an iframeable AoE on everyone, to survive this people need to spread so that the AoE does not overlap.
* They do 50% HP damage in Normal Mode and 75% in Hard Mode.
  * If you hit the boss with an AoE in hard mode the gauge will add 30 to it.

**Gauge fills** - The gauge will appear when the boss reaches 90% HP, with 5 pillars activating across the room, much like in RK9 Extreme Mode.
* This gauge will then slowly charge up to 100 stacks and when it reaches a 100 the pillars will spawn an orb before them. 
* Every member of the party needs to collect (touch, don’t need to hit) an orb to survive the incoming room wide people attack.

*Note:* The pillars fire AoEs of electricity when a player is nearby, These AoEs will either stun you, or pushback and put bleed on you. <br>
Make sure to dodge the AoE that will most likely get fired when you go collect the orb.

**Hard Mode:** If the boss is below 50% then this boss will then target one player with fairly wide laser attack that requires people to gather and split the damage to for tank to survive it. Don’t leave your tank hanging.

To gain the opposing buff you just have to gather around the book and then someone has to hit it to give everyone in the area the buff. <br>
Not having this boss will make it hard to survive during the specific elemental mechanics.

<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Hard Mode Only**

**No Type** - The boss targets a player, fires a laser that needs to be dodged.
* (read: not iframed but avoided – use movement skills).
* Pulls in the target if hit and then puts a small unavoidable AoE under them which removes elemental buff from everyone hit.

Try to refresh it as soon as possible to avoid bleeding.

<h3>Last Boss: Harnovog</h3>
<center><h3>Key Mechanics</h3></center>

**Demon Mechanic** - He will say a message:

    Let the game begin.

One person needs to get hit by this AoE attack, they will turn into a demon and gain more attack damage but have reduced defenses. 
* Dying while in Demon Form will do a mapwide AoE and damage every party member.

Then the Demon Player will get targeted by lasers which must be iframed, lasers hitting you means you die and explode.

**Tremble Before Me!** - A text message will indicate that this mechanic is coming.

    Tremble before me!

First he will do an AoE Stun followed by a large AoE that gives the boss stacks depending on how long people stand in it.

This will **stack up very fast and has 3 levels** of power: (Too little, Weak and Strong).
- **Too little** - he gets stunned
- **Weak** - it does some damage that can't be avoided
- **Strong** - he will most likely wipe the party (you can ress quickly without boss resetting)
