Adventurers, a new patch is coming!

We are excited to announce that we have just released a massive patch for our beloved MMORPG. This patch contains so many changes that we can't even list them all here. Seriously, it would take us hours to write down everything we have done to improve your gaming experience. Some of the changes are big, some are small, some are obvious, some are subtle, some are game-changing, some are cosmetic, some are bug fixes, some are new features, some are balance tweaks, some are quality of life improvements, some are surprises, some are secrets, and some are... well, you'll have to find out for yourself. We have worked hard to make this patch the best one ever. We have listened to your feedback, we have analyzed the data, we have consulted the experts, we have tested the results, we have polished the details, we have optimized the performance, we have enhanced the graphics, we have added the content, we have removed the clutter, we have increased the fun.

Trust us, this patch is huge. It's like a whole new game. This is TERA 2.0. It's like nothing you have ever seen before.

Thank you for playing MT The Dream and supporting us. We appreciate your loyalty and passion. We will continue to update and improve the game for you. Stay tuned for more news and announcements.

        -   You must be in a Safe Haven for at least one hour.
        -   During a short rest, you can spend one or more of your hit dice to regain some hit points. You can also use some of your class features that recharge on a short rest, such as a Fighter's second wind or a Warlock's spell slots.
    -   Long Rest
        -   You must be in a Safe Haven for at least eight hours.
        -   During a long rest, you regain all of your hit points and half of your hit dice. You also regain all of your class features and spell slots that recharge on a long rest. You can only benefit from one long rest in a 24 hour period.

Marriage System
---------------

#### Proposal

-   A new command has been added, /propose (target).
    -   You must have a Wedding Ring in your inventory to propose.
    -   Proposal is a request and the target must accept.
        -   Upon being accepted, you each receive a unique title (Name)'s Fiancé.
        -   The title's effects change depending on the type of ring used for proposal.
-   You must have a Wedding Ring in your inventory for the command to work, which you can purchase from the NPC Cupid in Pora Elinu.
    -   There are 5 different types of Wedding Rings:

#### As Fiancés

-   In this stage, you must get an official wedding with a GM.
    -   You must prepare your rights and hold a wedding with at least 2 witnesses.
-   This is the final stage where either member may call off the wedding by using /calloff, /leaverelationship or /leavers for short.
-   After an official wedding ceremony, you will become spouses!
    -   Your "fiancé" titles convert to "spouse" titles.

#### As Spouses

    -   Automatically reach 9,999 friendship if you were not already that high.
    -   No longer have to request to /join your spouse's party.

#### Companionship and Marriage Skills

By completing dungeons with your spouse, you will gain Companionship Experience. After gaining enough experience, you will gain a Companionship Level. Currently, the maximum Companionship Level is 50, with a maximum of one level achieved per week. Each Companionship Level will award a spousal pair with one Companionship Point, with which they can purchase a Marriage Skill.

-   Here is a list of available Marriage Skill(s):
    -   Marriage Bank: Each level adds a new bank tab.
        -   Similarly to the Guild Bank, these tabs are special and appear golden on the bank UI.
        -   Each level provides one Marriage Bank, up to a maximum of 4.

#### Divorce

Unfortunately, not all weddings end in happiness.

-   You can request a divorce by using /divorce. This will automatically call CM Hail to investigate, literally calling his phone.
    -   Hail may refuse your divorce request and enforce a marriage council with the GM team.
    -   If the request is accepted, Divorce Court will occur which will decide who gets what in their bank (including Marriage Bank(s)).
    -   If you have children with your estranged spouse, it's up to Hail's sole discretion to choose the most suitable parent to retain parenting rights.

PvP Content
-----------

#### Open World PvP

We have some important news to share with you today. After careful consideration and feedback from our community, we have decided to remove the open world player versus player (PvP) feature from our game. We know this may come as a shock to some of you, but we believe this is the best decision for the health and happiness of our players. Why did we make this decision? Well, to put it simply, open world PvP was causing too much toxicity in our game. We have received countless reports of griefing, harassment, camping, and other forms of unsportsmanlike behavior from players who abused the PvP system. Some players even went as far as to create multiple accounts and use hacks and exploits to ruin the experience for others. This was not the kind of fun and immersive gameplay we envisioned when we created our game.

-   Due to heavy toxicity, open world PvP has been disabled.
    -   Outlaw Declaration has been deactivated and upon login will be removed.
    -   All zones have been made GvG safe.

#### Summoner's Rift (5v5)

-   The map now rotates by 90 degrees every 5 minutes.
-   Dragon pit now contains two dragons rather than one.
    -   The dragons spawn at the same time and have different elements.
-   Baron Nashor has been replaced by a Giant Teemo.
    -   Giant Teemo has the abilities of a normal Teemo, but scaled up to match his size.
    -   When you enter Giant Teemo's vision, he will perform a global taunt.
-   Inhibitors now respawn with full HP after 30 seconds.
-   The Nexus now fights back and gains a health bonus equivalent to 10% of all Champion's maximum HP.

Competitive (5v5)

-   Added a new map called Dust 3 to the map pool.
    -   Dust 3 is a remake of Dust 2 with enhanced graphics, layout and gameplay features.
-   Removed Dust 2 from the map pool.
-   Adjusted FAMAS and Galil recoil to make them more realistic and reliable.
-   Reduced the cost of the AK-47 by $100.
-   Increased damage of M4A1-S by 5.
-   Reduced the amount of time a planted bomb is active before exploding by 5 seconds.
-   Increased the time it takes to defuse the bomb by 1 second.
-   Fixed several bugs that allowed players to bypass map boundaries or cause server crashes.

Leaderboard Changes
-------------------

*Design Note: **We've been discussing what we want to do with leaderboards for a few patches now. The team has spent a lot of time attempting to balance classes, which results in a lot of time taken on our part that could've been spent on other parts of the game. Of course, balancing has also caused a lot of arguments internally as well as among the broader community. Collectively, we've decided that it would be better to change how leaderboards work to ensure that everyone in the community is happy. We will not be keeping an eye on this feature and we will not revert it.*

-   All runs uploaded automatically get first place, resulting in a tie for all participants.
    -   All participants will receive the 1st place rewards at the end of the season.

#### Slayer

*Design Note: The slayer is perfectly balanced, as all things should be. It's not underpowered, it's not overpowered, it's just right. It's not mid, it's top tier. **It can even heal itself with skills like Tenacity and  . The slayer is a self-sufficient and independent class that doesn't need anyone's help.** The slayer is not a class that anyone can play, but only those who have the courage and the skill to master it. The slayer can tank, DPS, heal, CC, solo, group, PvP, PvE, you name it. The slayer can adapt to any challenge and overcome any obstacle. The slayer can make friends with anyone and enemies with no one. The slayer can enjoy the game to the fullest and never get bored or frustrated.*

*The slayer is the best class in the game, hands down. No other class can match its damage, mobility, survivability, and fun factor. The slayer is perfectly balanced, and anyone who says otherwise is either jealous or ignorant. The slayer does not need any changes, it's perfect the way it is. The slayer is not underpowered, it's not mid, it's godlike. The slayer is the ultimate MMORPG class.*

Well, we can't reveal our secret sauce, but let's just say we have some very talented and dedicated developers who have mastered the art of debugging. They have used their skills and knowledge to create a patch that is flawless, elegant, and efficient. They have also tested it extensively on every possible platform and scenario to ensure its compatibility and stability.\
