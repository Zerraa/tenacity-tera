## Boss: Ironfang Dixie
### Key Mechanics

**Front Stun** - When Dixie's eyes quickly flash red, he will perform a stun axe slam on the tank.
* If you fail to iframe this, he will then knock you away. Possibly off the ship if you wont have enough space behind you.
  * This isnt blockable, but it is iframable
