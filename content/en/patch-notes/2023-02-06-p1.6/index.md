There is a lot going on with this patch, so we'll split this design note into two sections with bullet points. Hopefully this'll help highlight what we believe are the most important changes for our players to see. This is the first time since we have joined the team that we've been making such large notable changes for both PvE and PvP simultaneously.

### PvE

-   We have received a lot of valuable feedback, with a common trend of feeling tired of our current lineup. We hear you, and we're preparing to release new stuff! We want to provide you with new content that has a reason to be played. It's easy to rotate dungeons out, but it's a lot harder to prevent the new content from getting boring and stale without a twist and/or incentive. We're currently working on customizing mechanics and creating more interesting things, and this patch includes some of these changes as a teaser to show off our capabilities.

-   A major change that we're making in this patch is that Brawler DPS is now viable, and should deal similar damage to all other DPS classes. We've also made many other class changes in this patch which lay the framework for us to fine tune classes easier in the future. For a short time, class balance will be up in the air; this is something we're aware of and okay with as long as it stays in a specific margin. This is also true with our new dungeon rotations, as we won't have data on them. The goal is to allow us to make changes faster without taking our entire focus on it to get right.

-   As we promised, we've begun the initial phase of improving new player progression. We're tackling some of the most urgent core issues we've heard from you. We've been getting a large influx of new players recently, and it's important to take care of them for the health of the server.

-   Regarding our recent sneak peeks, we've been seeing a lot of the community taking them as the absolute truth of our future content. We show off some things that may or may not enter the game. Even if we do plan to release something, a sneak peek may be something that'll come out a week from now, or a month from now. So please do not treat sneak peeks as something that'll happen soon or even at all! We adapt our roadmap according to what is most important at the moment, and what is possible for us.

-   We have planned some interesting events, so please stay tuned for more information soon! Many of you are concerned with Manglemire, and we can safely say that it'll stay around for a bit longer. It'll be swapped out when we have another dungeon lined up to take its place, which you'll be made aware of well before it happens.

### PvP

-   We have been listening very closely to your feedback, and we feel that we're much more capable to handle PvP now than we were in the past. Our main goal with this patch is to address the utmost concerns first and foremost. We will not be perfect, but we're looking to take steps in the right direction. We will be seeking frequent patches to continue addressing your concerns.

-   We understand that class balance is not in a great state right now, especially when paired with healer Velocity. We are acutely aware of the situation and will continue to monitor it while we're tackling more urgent issues. Balancing will be our focus when we're happier with the overall content offering and viability of playing PvP to begin with.

-   We understand that Fraywind Canyon is an extremely popular battleground, but the version we have has issues that we are currently unable to solve. Although our battleground changes are experimental, we want to sate your immediate desire to queue into a functional and somewhat fun battleground. We will look into Fraywind Canyon more in the future, when the dust has settled.

-   We plan to release dedicated PvP content in the near future, after we address the urgent concerns to make PvP enjoyable. In the interim, we will monitor and gather feedback about the state of PvP. Welcome back to MT: The Dream, we will do our best to serve you.

Best Regards, Hail (Community Manager) & Icha (Content Lead ─ PvE & PvP)

Class Changes
-------------

Design Note: Balancing in TERA has always relied on the tanks, especially considering how every damage dealer (so called "DD") class synergizes differently with each tank. We have reworked the unique party buffs that each tank can provide with the goal of improving these synergies, and making DD classes less reliant on a single tank for peak performance. On one hand, we want to provide something fresh and unique for our players; and on the other, the unbalanced synergies between DDs and tanks caused problematic balancing concerns. Lancer and Warrior now provide both cooldown reduction and skill damage, with the amounts of each varying depending on the class affected. The buff values have been carefully decided and should increase damage across the board, providing players with extra cooldown reduction where necessary to utilize the higher amount of attack speed they've gained. We will continue to monitor how classes perform with these changes, and tweak the changes in the future; so please upload some runs and see how the changes feel. Let us know what you think once you get used to them!

Additionally, evasion skills have received a major overhaul in this patch. A common point of contention with high attack speed gameplay is that it reduces the amount of invincibility frames (so called "iframes") from evasion skills. In our investigation, we've found that some of these skills had extremely low and nearly unusable iframe windows. When pairing the low iframe windows with high ping, these skills are completely unreliable. We want to make sure that everyone can enjoy MT: The Dream, no matter where they're playing from, so all classes have had their evasion skills adjusted so that the iframe window matches the duration of the animation, sometimes longer. Many skills benefited from this by becoming much longer, with no evasion skill having an iframe window below 0.65 seconds.

### Lancer

Design Note: The buffs provided by the reworked Adrenaline Rush effect is approximate, as it varies class-to-class based on their performance with CDR. Every class receives some skill damage% and final cooldown reduction%, but the amounts will slightly differ.

-   Adrenaline Rush

-   Reworked the party effect (does not affect the caster's buff):

-   Increases Attack Speed by 25%.

-   Increases Skill Damage by ~11% when attacking monsters.

-   Reduces final cooldown of Attacking Skills under 60s by ~15%.

-   Guardian Shout

-   Increases Endurance by 91%.

-   Skill Damage increases by 3% while within 40m of the caster.

### Brawler

Design Note: Due to the reworks that Lancer and Defensive Stance Warrior have received, Brawlers also needed some love to remain an attractive and viable option. Brawler has always been the "high damage but no attack speed" tank, and we wanted to continue that trend by giving a very strong damage buff. Coupled with the Internal Wound endurance debuff, a Brawler's party members will land the highest damage per hit achievable in the game. Furthermore, we've also been looking into Growing Fury's Irregular advancement, aka Brawler's "DPS Stance", and have reworked it to be more enjoyable and in line with other DPS classes.

-   Rhythmic Blows

-   "Vibration" buff now increases Power and Attack Speed by 30% but can no longer stack.

-   First hit applies a new party buff: "Furious Blows"

-   Increases Skill Damage by 10% for 20 seconds.

-   Does not affect the caster.

-   Haymaker's Resonance Advancement

-   A successful hit of Haymaker increases all Skill Damage for you and party members by 3.7% for 8 seconds.

-   Improved how the effect applies to avoid several bugs.

-   Haymaker's Weak Spot Thrust Advancement

-   Increases Haymaker damage dealt from behind by 20%.

-   A successful hit of Haymaker reduces the cooldown of Flying Kick by 1.5 seconds.

-   Haymaker's Resonance and Rhythmic Blows' Furious Blows effects do not apply in PvP, and require the Brawler to be in Growing Fury. These effects do not apply if the Brawler is using Growing Fury's Irregular Advancement.

-   Growing Fury's Irregular Advancement

-   Increases all damage by 45%.

-   Increases damage dealt from behind against monsters by an additional 40%.

-   Increases damage of One-Inch Punch by 20% against monsters.

-   Increases damage of Rhythmic Blows by 350% against monsters.

### Warrior

Design Note: Similar to the Adrenaline Rush rework, One With The Sword change affects classes differently based on their performance with attack speed. Every class, when paired with Warrior Tank, now receives some skill damage% and final cooldown reduction%, but the amounts slightly differ from class-to-class. In addition to this, Warrior has been given a few QoL improvements to address some of long-standing vanilla bugs with the class. Lastly, Defensive Stance's damage reduction has been changed to affect "Skill Damage" only, resulting in an identical damage output as the prior buff, though it consolidates all tank buffs to that of the same type.

-   Quality of Life Improvements

-   Blade Waltz internal lockout now matches the lowest skill length of your next chained skill, resulting in much smoother chains.

-   Using a consumable after Blade Waltz no longer interrupts the next chained skill.

-   Defensive Stance

-   Now reduces Skill Damage by 7% instead of All Damage by 10%.

-   Combative Strike

-   Endurance debuff duration increased to 19s.

-   One With The Sword

-   Increases Skill Damage by ~6.5%.

-   Reduces final cooldown of Attacking Skills under 60s by ~7%.

### Berserker

-   Increased Axe's Attack Modifier to 60,121.

-   Tackle damage now applies as Physical.

-   Physical and Magical Factor has been adjusted accordingly.

### Gunner

-   Increased Arcannon's Attack Modifier to 52,740.

### Slayer

Design Note: It has been proven that Slayer is capable of performing very strongly with both Brawler and Lancer. It would have performed even stronger than previously after the tank buff changes, so the Greatsword's Attack Modifier has been reduced.

-   When casting In Cold Blood, the cooldown of Overhand Strike is reset.

-   Decreased Greatsword's Attack Modifier to 55,528.

### Sorcerer

Design Note:  These changes should finally address a bug we introduced back in July. In the future, we hope to curb these issues sooner rather than later. Thank you for your patience!

-   Warp Barrier has received multiple changes:

-   It will no longer cancel the Mana Boost effect while active.

-   Skill Prediction should also now correctly emulate Meteor Shower while Mana Boost and Warp Barrier are active simultaneously.

-   It no longer has a small invincibility frame delay, which previously caused deaths despite the skill being activated.

### Ninja

Design Note: Tightening the spreads of Harmonious Fire Avalanche and Harmonious Quick Attack to allow for full hits, on top of the changes to tank buffs has shown that Ninja performs above our expectations. As such, the Shuriken's Attack Modifier was reduced slightly.

-   The following skills have had their ranges tightened, allowing full hits on smaller targets:

-   Harmonious Fire Avalanche

-   Harmonious Quick Attack

-   Decreased Shuriken's Attack Modifier to 51,379.

### Reaper

Design Note: These changes should allow players to sync Shrouded Escape and Shadow Reaping seamlessly, improving both the fluidity of Reaper's gameplay and improving the consistency of their damage output. Providing Assassination on cast is a solution to a rather annoying caveat to how Shrouded Escape works, preventing you from losing Shrouded Escape to DOT or other unintentional causes. Lastly, the Cable Step and Enhanced Shadow Burst changes help high ping players, particularly as Cable Step is often poorly emulated by skill prediction.

-   Shrouded Escape has received multiple changes:

-   Base cooldown is now 70 seconds.

-   Now provides Assassination on cast, and refreshes its duration when Shrouded Escape is broken again.

-   Decreased the Cable Step attack speed abnormality to 30%.

-   Enhanced Shadow Burst now applies the Cable Step attack speed abnormality.

### Archer

Design Note: The changes to Rain of Arrows is a reaction to a common complaint about missing the skill due to target size in PvE. In addition, the Crit Power gained from Focus X has been removed and replaced with an Attack Modifier adjustment, allowing Archers to gain more value from Crit Power acquired from other sources, ultimately reducing preference to run solely with Priest over Mystic.

-   Feign Death will now remove aggro from all PvE monsters under Level 65.

-   Rain of Arrows Empowered Advancement

-   Now increases Area of Effect by 40%.

-   Reduces cast distance by 25%.

-   Reduces PvP Damage by 30%.

-   Visual displays the correct Rain of Arrows size.

-   The Focus X buff no longer provides Crit Power.

-   Greatly increased Bow Attack Modifier to 64,507.

### Valkyrie

Design Note: We're aware of the community's opinion on Valkyrie's strength. While this change may look like a buff, when paired with the aforementioned tank changes, Valkyrie should be performing roughly as expected.

-   Increased Runeglaive Attack Modifier to 66,646.

### Mystic

Design Note: A common point of contention with Mystic competition is with prestacking motes, and these changes will address that. The changes to Arunic Release is designed to make Mystic less dependent on boss attack patterns and RNG from other sources, which could ruin runs by the boss jumping out of prestacked motes. Lastly, these changes may affect PvP in unintended ways. We will monitor how these changes perform in PvP and adjust accordingly if necessary.

-   Arun's Tears and Arun's Vitae have received multiple changes:

-   Cooldown has been increased to 7.5 seconds.

-   Prestacked motes will disappear in leaderboard dungeons.

-   Arunic Release has received multiple changes:

-   Cooldown has been reduced to 7.5 seconds.

-   Can only detonate 2 motes.

-   Increased skill damage by 22%.

-   Increased detonation range by 50%.

-   The following skills have had their mana costs reduced:

-   Arunic Release

-   Boomerang Pulse

-   Contagion

-   Thrall of Wrath

-   Thrall Augmentation's Elementalize is no longer a transformation, allowing you to access the Dressing Room without disabling Thrall Augmentation.

### Priest

Design Note:  We recently released a sneak peek of Priest with Double Backstep, but we have chosen to not release it due to PvP's resurgence. We knew the change would be very uncertain for PvP, and we would like to sit down and properly discuss it with the PvP side first before releasing it.

-   Shocking Implosion's size while affected by Edict of Judgment has been greatly increased.

### Various Classes

Design Note: Certain evasion skills have proven themselves to be too hard to use with high attack speed, especially when coupled with high ping. These changes ensure that no evasion skill has a duration under 0.65 seconds, which will help with both playability and reliability. These changes are noticeable on every class, but are most noticeable on Archer, Berserker, Mystic, Ninja, Priest, Sorcerer, Valkyrie, and Warrior.

-   The following abilities now have a fixed 0.65 second invincibility frame window:

-   Mystic's Teleport Jaunt

-   Priest's Backstep

-   Sorcerer's Backstep

-   Sorcerer's Teleport Jaunt

-   Every evasion skill in the game now has a matching invincibility frame duration window, matching the animation of the skill.

-   Chaining evasion skills together no longer risks leaving openings in the invincibility frame window.

New Player Progression
----------------------

Design Note: Previously, the new player experience on Menma's was extremely rough. You were rushed into dungeons, or rather a single dungeon that you were ill-equipped to handle. Likewise, the amount of items and tokens to click through when making a new character needed to be simplified. Jumping straight to Level 70 with nearly no explanation and then being expected to handle an overtuned Lilith's Keep as your first dungeon experience was unfair for new TERA players. We hope these changes will help, but these are just the beginning. Thank you for your feedback regarding the new player experience, please let us know if you think of a way to further improve it.

### Player Guidance

-   There is an in-game help menu which you can view with the system button (cog wheel icon). We have updated this to explain many of the mechanics in the game, from basic gearing to endgame systems.

-   When starting the game, the Item Level 455 experience has been expanded to include two new dungeons, and one new dungeon at Item Level 464. These should help ease players into higher-tiered content without feeling unfair.

### New Character Inventory

-   All newly created characters will have the following inventory items:

-   Amarun's Wisdom Box

-   Divine Infusions and Valkyon Health Potions

-   Rank 1 Relic and Halidom relevant for the class

-   Federation Supply: Accessory Box, which contains the following:

-   4x Powerful, Keen, and Swift Vyrsks

-   Full set of Pumped Ethereal Jewelry

-   10x Uncommon Accessory Morphers

-   2x Energetic Weapon & Glove Etching

-   2x Grounded Armor & Boot Etching

As such, we've increased the damage of nearly every class to get them closer into line with how we want PvP to feel.
