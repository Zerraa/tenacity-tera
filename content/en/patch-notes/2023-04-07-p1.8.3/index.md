Adventurers, a new patch is coming!

We know many of you are interested in our upcoming big patch, which we teased briefly in [Patch 1.8](https://menmastera.com/patch-notes-menmas-tera-1-8/). The entire team is working hard to make it the best it can be, but we're not ready to share more details yet. If you want to refresh your memory on what we've revealed this far, you can follow the previous link. We know you are eager to see what we have in store and to learn more about our plans, but we kindly ask for your patience until we're happier with the state of the patch. In the meantime, we will continue to improve our content offered in 1.8 and releasing events to keep the game as fresh and fun as possible.

Thank you for your continued support!\
─ Hail (Community Manager)
