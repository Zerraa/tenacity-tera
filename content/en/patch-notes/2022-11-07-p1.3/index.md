## Dungeon Changes
## New Dungeons
The following dungeons have been added:

- RK-9 Kennel – Item level 472.
- Dragon’s Lair (previously Commander’s Residence) – Item level 481.
- Demokron Factory (Hard) – Item level 485.

Dragon’s Lair will be available twice per character per day on the weekends, and the vanguard will be claimable once daily on Saturday + Sunday. Notable rewards include: Refined Mana Essence, Agaia Material Tokens, 10K Item XP. The raid can be accessed via scrolls sold by the Specialty Merchant, or via instance matching.<br>
Demokron Factory will be accessible as normal, and has been opened as a 10 man raid. Accessory rewards covered in the gear section below.

## Dungeon Adjustments
The dungeon changes below hopefully reflect feedback received from the community. The general consensus was to reduce time spent on preliminary bosses of dungeons such as Manaya’s Core and Sky Cruiser Endeavour, making the dungeons more enjoyable. Across the board, there have also been number of damage reductions on boss attacks which we felt were overtuned, allowing classes with lower endurance and defence modifiers to survive them. Draakon’s Arena (Hard) received a HP increase of 6 billion – being one of our core hard mode dungeons, we felt players were able to clear a bit faster than intended following the new accessories as well as the class fluidity improvements implemented last patch.

We have also reviewed the lower tiers of dungeons and ensured that there is a clear and fair path of progression for those returning or picking up the game. While the new player progression pathway is far from perfect, we believe this is a step in the right direction.

- Increased Agaia material drops from all sources, and added in smaller quantities to older dungeons.
- The following dungeons have been removed for future reworks:
  - Bathysmal Rise
  - Bathysmal Rise (Hard)
  - Akeron’s Inferno
  - Akeron’s Inferno (Hard)
  - Ravenous Gorge
  - Gossamer Vault (Hard)
  - Bahaar’s Sanctum
- Kaia’s Anvil quest requirement has been changed from Gossamer Vault (Hard) to Ruinous Manor.
- All remaining dungeons have had their item levels and drops adjusted to better reflect gear requirements and difficulty.
  - Vanguard reward boxes have also been adjusted and Luminous Mana Essence rewards buffed slightly.

## Class Changes
**State of Tanks:** We’re aware of the of the challenges tanks might face with the latest roster of dungeons, in particular Lancer. As Undying Warlord and Draakon Arena were released, we heard your feedback on the class and have buffed Lancer in such a way that makes manually blocking much more rewarding, as well as other QoL and damage buffs across the board.

**In Review:** The team is currently looking at other classes which may struggle in the new dungeon timers and fight structure, such as Ninja and Berserker, as well as QoL changes to improve the feel of gameplay. <br>
Warrior Tank is another tank that we’re paying close attention to – while it’s capable of putting up competitive leaderboard timers, we’re reviewing changes to overall make the tank feel “better” to play with, personal-damage wise. We’re also aware of the challenges Mystic faces in dungeons where they are unable to pre-stack motes and actively working on an alternative to fix these outliers.

As ever, we’re open to hearing your feedback on these changes so please do let us know.

### Archer
- Increased base damage of Radiant Arrow, Penetrating Arrow, Gust Arrow, and Thunderbolt by 5%.
- Increased buff of Howling String from 10% to 20%.
- Decreased base cooldown of Windsong by 5 seconds.

Archers are now correctly receiving fast-fastyness alongside other classes.<br>
Archer has been performing fairly poorly amongst the other DPS classes, even after considering that the current roster of leaderboard dungeons are tough for archer<br>
Following from some discussions in the Archer section in Discord, the direction we’d like to move archer in is more dynamic in its rotation and less reliant on Rapid Fire resets, particularly during Windsong. These changes lay the foundation for further changes while also looking to make archer more competitive short-term, as we look into what’s possible with Powerlinks, Find Weakness, and Shrieking Arrow passives.

### Slayer
- Increased Overhand Strike Focus duration from 7s to 10s
- Split damage is now added to Unsheathe (Ultimate).
- Punishing blow now applies propulsion effect (reduces the cooldown of Unsheathe again) (in PvP).

Maintaining Overhand Strike Focus stacks are extremely important for Slayer’s DPS, and boss mechanics that force the players away from the boss for several seconds is detrimental to their overall damage. Increasing the duration should help with keeping those stacks up.

### Gunner
- Increased chance to spawn Arcane Splash upon successful Mana Missile hits.
- Increased projectile speed of Mana Missiles by 50%.
- Adjusted Burst Fire and Targeted Burst Fire’s scaling with Magical Crit Power.
- Balder’s Vengeance is now stunnable (in PvP).

We are aware that Gunner is a bit underwhelming right now, so these changes/bugfixes are the first step to make Gunner overall better. The increased chance to spawn Arcane Splash helps Gunner to be more consistent with the previous changes made to Mana Missiles, while the Burst Fire/Targeted Burst Fire buff rewards players prioritizing those skills.

### Lancer
- Pumped Stand Fast: 50% chance to increase power by 25% and crit factor by 25% for 10s on a successful block.
  - Previously: 30% chance to increase power by 15% for 10s
- Powerlinked Stand Fast: Increases skill damage of Shield Counter by 50% for a few seconds.
  - Previously: Increases skill damage of Shield Counter by 25%
- Empowered Onslaught: Increases skill damage by 40%.
  - Previously: Increases skill damage by 25%.

We feel these changes should make manually blocking, and chaining Shield Counter from block much more rewarding than previous patches. In the latest roster of dungeons, where Lancer finds itself trading HPM for survivability, the aforementioned changes should complement the reactive nature of Lancer’s gameplay, while increasing its damage output particularly in dungeons where blocking incoming boss attacks are mandatory. We’ll be paying close attention to how Lancer and Lancer-based part compositions perform in the next few weeks, tweaking values and potentially adding additional buffs where suitable.

### Priest
- Reduced healing of Healing Immersion by 30% in PvP.
- Increased duration of Divine Charge from 11s to 12s.
- Increased cooldown of Divine Charge from 24s to 25s.

Among leaderboard and parse parties, Priest has already become popular for parties and classes that burst every 58s because of edict buff synchro. This change is a little sprinkle on top for priest competitiveness. The extra 1 second cooldown means you only need to cast one divine charge per edict, which allows priests to minmax their edict rotation with less drawbacks to their uptimes.

### Warrior
- Scythe PvP damage has been reduced by 40%.

### Warrior (Tank)
- Attack Speed Glyphs from other classes now stack with Warrior Traverse Cut (Party)

Previously, classes with attack speed glyphs (eg. Gunner, Ninja, Warrior etc.) would have these overwritten by the party Traverse Cut buff, effectively reducing their speed when playing with a Warrior Tank. Increasing Warrior Tank’s desirability amongst DPS classes is something we’re currently looking into, but this is a small change that should help for the time being.

### Mystic
- Increased HP and Defense of Warding Totem.
- Thrall of Life healing has been reduced by 10% in PvP.

Note we are also currently looking into Mystic’s inability to prestack motes in certain dungeons.

### Brawler
- Added ‘Sapping Provoke’ glyph:
  - 100% chance to stun target for 2 seconds when attacking a monster.

### Ninja
- Attunement now applies all effects and goes on cooldown as soon as the skill is cast.

We are looking into further changes for Ninja and hope to have something for next patch.

### Berserker
- Cyclone PvP damage has been reduced by 30%.

### Sorcerer
- Split damage is now removed from Implosion (Ultimate).

### Skills Changes
- Retaliate is set to go on cooldown once casted (Slayer, Archer, Gunner, ect.). Players CANNOT reset retaliate anymore.
- Fixed a bug which allowed players to reset their racial abilities.
