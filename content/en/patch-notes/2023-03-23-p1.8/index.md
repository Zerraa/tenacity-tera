Adventurers, a new patch is coming!

## Future Plans

While this patch cycle and its dungeons are coming to a close, the entire team is hard at work on a big content patch. We promise that this upcoming patch is bigger and better than anything we've done before, and includes major changes for both PvE and PvP. <br>
Additionally, we even hope to include proper translations in full for French and German. The entire team is incredibly excited, and we can't wait to share more information with you.

To give a bit of a sneak peek, for PvE players you can expect to get an all new set of gear to work towards, with new unlocks to farm for! With new gear means a new dungeon rotation, so get ready to see some critically acclaimed dungeons make their return. <br>
We also have an *all-new* dungeon system planned which will keep even the most battle-tested adventurers on their toes. Last but not least, for those who are interested in PvP, we aim to release an all new set of OWPvP gear to add progression while drastically improving our battleground balance.

Thank you for your support!\
─ Hail (Community Manager)

Battle Pass: Season II
----------------------

### Information

The highly anticipated Battle Pass is making a return for its second season! Players can now farm for Menma's Hero Tokens *(known as Hunter Tokens in Season I)* by participating in either PvE or PvP content. You can redeem your hard earned Hero Tokens for exclusive rewards such as eternal pets, new costumes, new innerwear, and much more! To learn more about this season of the Battle Pass and its rewards, head over to our Discord server and check out the event channel for more detailed information.

Dungeon Changes
---------------

### Miscellaneous

-   Removed boss HP bar shakes when dealing damage.

Class Changes
-------------

{{< alert context="info" >}}
**Design Note:** After our recent adjustments, we've noticed that certain classes outperform our expectations with specific tank matchups. However on the other hand, some classes struggle significantly when paired with a specific tank. With this patch we've addressed these issues, and the respective classes were adjusted accordingly. On top of fixing these issues we also improved the consistency of most skill advancements, which increases class damage consistency rather than outright increasing their damage dealt.<hr>
* We've also been paying close attention to Mystic after our recent changes, as promised. There has been a lot of player feedback surrounding Mystic, and we're grateful that our changes have gotten the community to discuss their opinions more openly. This patch has changes to Mystic which will change its skill priority, returning some much needed variance to their rotation which was heavily requested based on your feedback.<hr>
* Lastly, we've squeezed in a much needed buff to warrior tank which will bring it up to par with Brawler and Lancer.
