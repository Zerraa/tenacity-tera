## BAMs inside Civil Unrest

During the battle, powerful enemies occasionally make an appearance on the battlefield, their arrival accompanied by a chat message announcement. <br>
If you and your guild manage to kill a BAM, **your group will be rewarded** with a buff for **half an hour** which will serve you well for your efforts in the guild war. 

**The following BAMs are waiting :** <br>
**Lavathus, Lord of the Lake**
- Lavathus appears after 30 minutes’ combat. 
- Defeating him will provide a buff which increases defence by 20%.

**Drakhan, Tyrant of Gidd Mountain**
- Drakhan appears after 60 minutes’ combat. 
- The guild which slays the tyrant receives a buff which increases attack power by 5% and HP by 10%.

**Kaithan, King of Crabs**
- Kaithan appears after 90 minutes’ combat. 
- The crab king provides a buff which increases both attack speed and critical hit chance by 20%.
