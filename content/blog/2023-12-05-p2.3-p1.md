Foreword
--------

#### PvE

(Icha/Hail) This patch will be released in parts just like we've done before. Additional changes, including dungeons, should be coming in the next week or so. As usual, we want to take the time to add the finishing touches and release good content rather than content for the sake of something to do.

(Hail) Something we've been seeing for awhile now is every time a new or returning player comes to our server, they often have mixed or wholly negative feedback regarding our gearing (from fresh character -> Resplendent gear)... Some of the common feedback is that the difficulty curve leaves much to be desired (mostly from new players), and often that the dungeons are just not fun (from pretty much everyone). This is something that I've been tackling in the past week, and will continue to do so. I'm not at the point right now to give an ETA, but it's my hope to rework the new player experience to be more engaging with better content offerings sooner rather than later.

#### PvP

(Icha/Hail) We've been taking aim at the Champion's Skyring lately to address pain points that make the game less fun to play. Our hope is to get games popping more frequently again to garner more feedback to improve the content further. Of course, we haven't forgotten about other content offerings, and we're hard at work with other things that we hope to show you soon.

#### Wintera Snowfield

-   Battleground now available during the event period.

-   An ominous air looms over the Snowfield... Unlike most years, the Old Man Winters will stake their claim on the territory during the fight! Hitting him with enough Snowballs will make him flee, and provide your team with a buff!

[PvE] Dungeon Changes
---------------------

#### Channelworks

-   Sentry AA-23

-   The laser mechanic now only occurs twice at 75% and 25%.

-   No longer goes immune during the laser mechanic.

-   Damage of laser mechanic greatly reduced.

#### Ruinous Manor

-   Malgarios

-   Fixed an issue where the baby spider wouldn't eat the egg and get stuck.

#### Timescape

-   Added a dragon teleport in the monster gauntlet if you accidentally take the wrong teleport.

-   Timesphere

-   After defeating all three, cooldowns are reset and all players are revived.

#### Velik's Sanctuary

-   Revived Darkan

-   Can now be hit from the floor when he flies into the air.

-   Lakan

-   Reduced damage of the red aura during Transition at 30%:

-   50,000 → 20,000 damage per tick

-   Tick increased from 100ms → 200ms

Class Changes
-------------

-   Fixed a bug which locked players out of casting i-frame skills after they were hit with a knock-up skill during their Retaliate.

-   This bug has been in the game since Brawler release (8 years), and is something that most (if not all) PvPers will have experienced at some point. This bug would occur if you are hit with any knock-up skill (such as Impact Bomb) during your Retaliate skill animation.

#### Archer

-   Find Weakness

-   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Skill disabled.

Design Note: This is a quick solution to accommodate for the global overcharge damage adjustment in a previous patch causing Radiant Arrow to deal far too much damage. This change may be adjusted or replaced with a different solution in the future.

#### Berserker

-   Bloodlust

-   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Reduced damage by 10% while active.

#### Lancer

-   Adrenaline Rush

-   March Advancement

-   Adjusted tooltip to reflect that it only applies to the caster.

-   Increased personal attack speed by an additional 6.4%.

-   Adrenaline Rush [March] was missing 6.4% attack speed compared to default Adrenaline Rush and Strenuous. This change brings default Adrenaline Rush and the March and Strenuous advancements to the same attack speed value.

-   Strenuous Advancement

-   Fixed a bug which caused Adrenaline Rush [Strenuous] to not be removed with a Mystic's Regression or Priest's Plague of Exhaustion.

-   Rallying Cry

-   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Now applies only to the caster.

-   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Increased base duration by 25%.

Design Note: Rallying Cry tends to make games last too long by preventing players from dying. The counterplay to this is often to shift focus solely on the Lancer or the round ends in a draw, which doesn't contribute to a fun gameplay experience. This change will help make Rallying Cry feel more balanced and make Lancer counterplay feel better. This change may be adjusted or replaced with a different solution in the future.

#### Mystic

-   Arunic Release

-   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Doubled healing amount.

-   Augmented Thrall of Protection

-   Changed how the skill functions:

-   NEW: Applies to yourself and 4 members of your party or raid within the AoE based on lowest HP.

-   OLD: Applies to yourself and 4 members of your party within the AoE.

-   Functionally this change makes the skill work more similarly to Kaia's Shield, with a different range check (AoE vs thrall circle).

-   Spawns 300ms sooner.

-   Fixed a bug which caused Popori Mystics to have a faster Regression than other races.

-   Fixed two bugs with Popori Mystic's Curse of Confusion, Curse of Exhaustion, Mire, and Sonorous Dreams:

-   No longer has an increased lock-on distance compared to other races

-   No longer has a faster casting speed than other races

Design Note: After 2.0, Mystic's Arunic Release had its healing reduced by 300% to make it scale with the healing lines on PvE gear. This change will help make Arunic Release a valuable skill in a Mystic's kit again. This change might leave 3s, but for now we didn't want to affect the overall PvP balance.

#### Ninja

-   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Reduced overall damage by 10%.

Design Note: Ninja as a class is outperforming our metrics, even with Inner Harmony being disabled in Champion's Skyring. This change will bring Ninja closer to our intended balance level.

#### Sorcerer

-   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Increased overall damage by 10%.

#### Valkyrie

-   Fixed a bug where Retaliate during Ragnarok didn't have the same fix applied to other Retaliates.

-   Retaliate's Anti-KD/Stagger abnormality now applies instantly.

-   On cast, cleanses Nerve Exhaustion.

-   While Retaliate's abnormality is active, Nerve Exhaustion cannot apply.

[Event] Battle Pass: Season III
-------------------------------

Event Period: October 19th, 2023 ~ December 19th, 2023

-   As the event reaches its final week, you can now convert your PvE and PvP tokens in a 1:1 exchange.

General Content
---------------

#### Baldera District

-   Reduced the Attack of Tenacious Forest Ovoliths by 30%.

#### Seren's Garden

-   The "Wrath of Nature" effect now properly clears after exiting the dungeon.

-   Changed how the entrance works:

-   You must now claim a quest in Hydrangea, then talk with the entrance NPC.

-   Upon /reset or after exiting, you can no longer enter Seren's Garden until the next daily reset.

-   Daily quest reset occurs at 7AM UTC.

[PvP] Rally Changes
-------------------

#### Sacred Noruk (Friday)

-   Increased reset distance by 50%.

-   Fixed an issue where the walk/run speed was incorrect.

-   Adjusted AI as follows:

-   No longer enters a forced walking state.

-   No longer randomly aggros.

Miscellaneous
-------------

-   Added the following new hair color to Meruma's Dream Hairstyle:

-   Light Pink

-   Light Purple

-   Adjusted the location of Shunin (Cleric) on the Velika Outskirts Dueling Pad.

-   Adjusted price of Elinu's Tears from the Vanguard Credits from 1500 → 1600.

-   This puts the price in-line with the Astrum Coin price of 800.

-   Enabled winter decoration in Balderon and all other cities.

-   Features the following notable additions:

-   New Winter decoration added to the following locations:

-   Velika Outskirts Hall

-   Velika Outskirts Dueling Pad

-   Civil Unrest Rank 1~3 Skycastles

-   Added Winter music to Balderon

-   Replaced the Guard on the Velika Outskirts Dueling Pad with Blakewell, a Banker NPC.

-   Increased the chance of the FWC Winners Loading Screen.
