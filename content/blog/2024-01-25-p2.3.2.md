Menma's Official Skill Prediction
---------------------------------

Internally, we've been working on a custom Skill Prediction solution to allow us to do further changes and fix a myriad of issues. We feel that it's in a good enough place for others to use it and let us know if you encounter any issues. We highly recommend you update and help us make it better, as it will be our official solution moving forward.

#### Fixed Issues / Features

-   Skill lengths have been adjusted across the board to better match their correct lengths.

-   Mystic's Augmented Thrall of Vengeance no longer has a longer animation lock than intended.

-   Mystic's Corruption Ring length has been adjusted to match the current, shorter length.

-   Ninja's Fire Avalanche no longer consumes Chi.

-   Priest's Divine Charge has the correct physical skill size when Glyph of Longshot is applied.

-   Priest's Guardian Sanctuary is enabled during Edict of Judgment.

-   Priest's Kaia's Shield is enabled during Edict of Judgment.

-   Priest's Resurrect now has the correct length.

-   Warrior's Blade Waltz lockout has been adjusted.

[PvE] Gear Changes
------------------

-   Corrected an issue where the Frozen Agaia Rings and Scorching Agaia Necklace had 10 less Magical or Physical Amplification as intended.

[PvE] Dungeon Changes
---------------------

Design Note: With the release of Frozen Bahaar's Sanctum and the Killing Grounds, we've been changing the enemy's Defense rather than simply scaling their HP. This reduced damage numbers to a more palatable level, while simultaneously protecting us from reaching the damage cap. We will continue this trend on existing bosses for consistency. You should see no-to-minimal change to dungeon cleartimes as a result of this change.

-   The following dungeons have had their Defense and HP tweaked, including shields where applicable:

-   Channelworks

-   Dreadspire

-   Kalivan's Dreadnaught

-   Kezzel's Gorge

-   Lilith's Keep

-   Ruinous Manor

-   Antaroth's Abyss

-   Timescape

-   Red Refuge

-   Red Refuge (Hard)

-   Velik's Hold (Hard)

-   Velik's Sanctuary

-   Velik's Sanctuary (Hard)

-   Lumikan's Dream

-   Lumikan's Dream (Hard)

-   Grotto of Lost Souls

-   Grotto of Lost Souls (Hard)

-   Dark Reach Citadel

-   Dark Reach Citadel (Hard)

-   Shadow Sanguinary

-   Shadow Sanguinary (Hard)

#### Channelworks, Kezzel's Gorge

-   Increased the drop rate of Relic and Halidom Tokens.

#### Kalivan's Dreadnaught, Lilith's Keep

-   Greatly increased the drop rate of Relic and Halidom Tokens.

#### Dreadspire

-   All bosses can no longer resist abnormalities applied to them.

#### Frozen Bahaar's Sanctum

-   Increased Phase 2 Bahaar's HP by 5.4%.

-   Only Mystic and Priest can hit Bahaar's Skeletons.

-   Removed split damage from player skills while in the instance.

-   Warrior's Battle Cry skill will now reliably stun Bahaar.

-   Various attacks that previously turned Bahaar will now guarantee tanks deal damage from the front and DPS/Healers deal damage from the back for the duration that Bahaar is turned.

-   You can see this effect through your abnormalities whenever this effect is active:

-   ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/pBzvslVkGlrVmJgY8GQQRooML8KrlX0CNzqrGe7RqgGdg_ydjTJ2NtzhytXAWsvnirtuUyhpyfQAax49Dzn87EGHUGPwXqRnYyDI64Y6H_lvJQAvGtW5_iSV6yuq8prMu-qk0RJppaGli-wmenJtgx8) DPS / Healer

#### Grotto of Lost Souls (Hard)

-   All bosses can no longer resist abnormalities applied to them.

-   Nightmare Kylos

-   Reduced HP by 5%.

-   Increased fight time from 8:00 → 10:00.

-   Exploding orbs HP reduced from 150 million → 125 million.

#### Killing Grounds

-   The message informing the player of the Gardan's Rage mechanic only occurs at the start of the fight.

#### Crimson Killing Grounds

-   Increased Nightmare Gardan's HP by 9.5%.

-   The message informing the player of the Gardan's Rage mechanic only occurs at the start of the fight.

Design Note: This dungeon has a fight time of under five minutes, which wasn't our intention due to it being a main top tier dungeon and leaderboard dungeon. This adjustment to HP should equalize the fight times between Bahaar's Sanctum and Crimson Killing Grounds. We'll keep an eye on the dungeon and make further changes as necessary.

#### Lumikan's Dream

-   Increased the amount of Lumikan's Wing Fragment drops from 5 → 10.

#### Velik's Sanctuary

-   Revived Dakuryon

-   Reduced HP by 20%.

-   Reduced damage dealt from cage attack from 80% HP → 40% HP.

[Event] Snowbound Sabotage
--------------------------

-   This event has ended, and the Wintera Snowfield has been closed. Thank you for participating! If you still have leftover [Event] Polar Snowflake, be sure to trade them in Balderon or at the Velika Outskirts Hall for exclusive rewards!

Class Changes
-------------

#### Archer

-   [PvE]  Increased overall damage by 1.5%.

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring]  Reverted a previous change which reduced overall damage by 10%.

-   Feign Death

-   [PvP] Glorious Enhancement: Reduced the duration of invincibility frames provided by 1.5 seconds.

-   At maximum Enhancement level, the invincibility duration is now 2 seconds rather than 3.5.

-   Incendiary Arrow

-   [PvP] Fixed an issue which caused players to not get knocked down occasionally from the skill.

-   Rain of Arrows

-   Increased skill tick rate, reducing the length of arrows raining from 3.5s → 2s.

-   The skill still deals the full damage despite being faster.

-   Thunderbolt

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring] No longer splits damage between targets.

-   Windsong

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring] Reduced damage during the effect by 10%.

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring] Gust Advancement: Removed the debuff which increased damage taken by 10%.

Design Note: [PvP]  Combining Archer's strong mobility and its aggressive 100-to-0 combo results in them often being an aggravating and unfun experience to face against, especially in 1v1 scenarios. Archer had to be kept rather weak in both small and large scale fights to not indirectly buff its already strong combo damage and its duel performance. We'll be taking a closer look at Archer as a whole soon, so stay tuned.

#### Brawler

-   [PvE]  Reduced overall damage by 1.8% when affected by Growing Fury's Irregular Advancement.

#### Berserker

-   [PvE]  Reduced overall damage by 3.2%.

-   Bloodlust

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring] Charisma Advancement: Removed the debuff which increased damage taken by 10%.

-   Sweeping Strike

-   Glyph of Persistence: Added a 4 second cooldown between activations.

#### Lancer

-   Backstep

-   Reload Enhancement: Corrected an issue with the tooltip erroneously mentioning a Reset Chance rather than reducing the Resolve cost of the skill.

-   Pledge of Protection

-   Fixed an issue which caused the skill to absorb approximately 16% more damage than intended.

-   Damage reduction effect now only applies to the caster.

-   Doesn't apply raid wide.

#### Mystic

-   Mass Teleport

-   Added a new 0 point cost glyph which removes the party teleportation effect while active.

-   Thrall of Life

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring] Glyph of Persistence: No longer functions.

-   Thrall of Protection

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring] No longer spawns the Thrall when cast.

-   All other effects of the skill remain.

-   Vow of Rebirth

-   Fixed an issue which allowed players to apply Vow of Rebirth to the entire party when it was paired with the Bomb of Cooling in certain situations.

Design Note: We understand that while Mystic players want the class to be smoother and more enjoyable to play, those that face against Mystics often find it unenjoyable or even frustrating to fight against. Both of these are important and we're working hard to strike a balance without moving too far in either direction.

#### Ninja

-   [PvE]  Increased overall damage by 2%.

-   Attunement

-   Fixed an issue which caused the skill to enter cooldown without providing the effect if interrupted at a specific moment.

-   Smoke Bomb

-   Fixed an issue which provided the invincibility effect even while outside of the skill's area of effect.

-   Apex Glyph of Power has received various changes:

-   Reduced point cost from 5 → 3.

-   Skill damage increase now applies only against monsters.

-   Now provides invincibility frames.

-   Shadow Reaping

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring]  Reduced damage during the effect by 10%.

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring] Snare Advancement: No longer functions.

#### Slayer

-   [PvE]  Reduced overall damage by 2.6%.

-   Overpower

-   This skill's effect has gotten a complete rework:

-   Every 3rd cast of Heart Thrust deals 100% more damage.

-   Every 3rd cast of Punishing Blow deals 15% more skill damage.

-   Every 3rd cast of Whirlwind deals 33% more damage.

-   You must hit the target for a cast to count. Each skill's casts are tracked individually, meaning any third successful hit will get the increase regardless of skill order.

-   If you do not hit a target within 30 seconds, the counter for that skill resets.

#### Sorcerer

-   [PvE]  Increased overall damage by 1%.

-   Warp Barrier

-   Fixed an issue which caused the skill to enter cooldown without providing the effect if interrupted at a specific moment.

-   [PvE]  Increased overall damage by 1.5%.

-   Due to the aforementioned 1.5% overall buff, this is effectively a 5% reduction of overall damage.

-   While inside of a dungeon instance and while the Boss is not active, Warriors now have a 100% chance of activating Swift Evasive Roll.

-   Backstab

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring]  Reduced edge generation from 1 → 0.

-   While Glyph of Advantage is active, this skill will generate 1 Edge rather than 2.

-   Blade Draw

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring]  Reduced edge generation while under the effects of Deadly Gamble from 2 → 1.

-   While Glyph of Advantage is active, this skill will generate 2 Edge rather than 4.

-   Rain of Blows

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring]  Reduced edge generation while under the effects of Deadly Gamble from 4 → 2.

General Content
---------------

#### Achievements

-   Fixed an issue where the Prophets of Doom achievement gave 40 achievement points instead of the intended 30.

-   Updated the amount of possible achievement points.

-   Adjusted the amount of achievement point completion required for laurel tiers:

-   Bronze: 20% → 13%

-   Champion: 90% → 95%

-   Silver, Gold, and Diamond remain the same.

Design Note: We're looking into what we can do to make achievements more reliable, rather than leave them in their current state. These are a few of the initial things that were incorrect that we noticed, so they have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor and make further changes as necessary.

#### Arun's Legacy Reputation Vendor

-   Lancer stone will apply Adrenaline Rush to the player

-   Brawler stone will apply Haymaker (Resonance) permanently and Furious Blows to the player, Internal Wounds to the Simulacrum

-   Warrior stone will apply One With the Sword to the player and Armorbreaker to the Simulacrum

-   Destroying another stone will remove all buffs from the previous tank and apply new ones.
