#### Corrupted RK-9 Kennel

-   Although a party has cleared, we have determined that this run was illegitimate due to the use of bug(s). This run will be removed, and when a first party obtains a legitimate clear, they will get a special, unique server first clear title after maintenance. If necessary, we will manually apply this title to the appropriate, deserving party.\

-   Increased some drops from the dungeon.

-   Fixed an issue where the "Next Enrage" was displaying incorrect information.

-   Berserker's  Unbreakable no longer blocks Corrupted RK-9's "Drain" attack.

-   Gunner's ! Burst Fire and Targeted Burst Fire no longer causes reflected damage.

-   Fixed an issue where in certain positions, a Priest's Shocking Implosion's healing would not occur.

-   Fixed other bugs and exploits with the dungeon.

[PvE] Class Changes
-------------------

#### Priest

-   Shocking Implosion

-   Fixed an issue where during Edict of Judgment, the healing range did not match the damage range.

Design Note: A while ago we increased Shocking Implosion's range during Edict of Judgment. However, with the addition of Corrupted RK-9 Kennel we've noticed that this increase in range only applied to the skill's damage, rather than both damage and its healing. This fix will allow Shocking Implosion to heal your allies if you are within the increased radius (approximately 12~15m from the enemy).

General Content
---------------

#### Reputation

-   Added "Veilbound Gear Smart Box" to the Vanguard Reputation Merchant to the "Equipment" tab.

#### Balderon

-   Added Forbidden Arena [Hagufna] and Frozen Bahaar's Sanctum to the Baldera Dungeon Teleporters.

#### Achievements

-   Fixed an issue where Corrupted Skynest achievements were erroneously active.

-   Removed Sanctuary's Ruins (Hard) and Draakon Arena (Hard) achievements.

-   Moved Corsair's Stronghold achievements to their correct section.

#### Gathering

-   Reduced the gathering time of most gatherables related to quests to 1 second.

[PvP] Echoes of Argonea
-----------------------

-   Fixed issues with certain Ethereal Shadowstalker respawns.

#### Melkatran

-   Adjusted aggression to be Neutral rather than Hostile.

-   This means he will not fight unless provoked.

[PvP] Battlegrounds
-------------------

#### [Event (PvP)] Corsair's Stronghold

-   Increased overall Skill DMG from all classes by 10%.

-   Made the following changes to all Da Bomb variants:

-   Increased Skill DMG to 175,000

-   Increased radius by 2.5 meters

-   Fixed an issue where the visual did not match the real attack radius

-   Enabled [Battleground] Smilecracker.

-   Reduced Anchorstone's HP by 30%.

#### [PvP] Champion's Skyring

-   Updated the informative guide buff with the up-to-date information for the battleground.

[PvP] Class Changes
-------------------

####  Mystic

-   Thrall of Life

-   [Champion's Skyring] Reduced the healing from the Thrall entity by 15%.

-   This does not affect the initial healing caused by the initial cast.

Design Note: Although we reduced it in a previous patch, we still feel that Mystic's self-preservation during fights is far too strong. This change will reduce Mystic's survivability more, meaning we'll be keeping an even closer eye on them to make sure they still perform to our standard.

Miscellaneous
-------------

#### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed an issue where Bahaar and Hagufna's pet boxes were awarding old loot.

-   Fixed an issue where the Dream Club Supplies tooltip displayed the wrong contents.

-   Fixed an issue where the +9 Veilbound Enchant Scroll said it could not be banked when it can be.
