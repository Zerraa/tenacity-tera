Astrum Coin
-----------

-   Tikat has been updated to Astrum Coin.

-   All references to Tikat, including the icon, have changed accordingly.

[PvE] Dungeon Changes
---------------------

#### Dreadspire

-   Challenge #9: Darkan now drops Darkan's Ember.

-   Further increased the movement speed to the buff bosses get after the timer runs out.

-   Adjusted the map area to alleviate getting stuck on the barrier wall used in Challenge #5: Kelsaik.

-   Added a delay before spawning the 6th Challenge Crystal after defeating Challenge #5: Kelsaik.

-   Failing to balance the harmony between Fire and Ice just as Kelsaik dies in Challenge #5 will no longer spawn both Challenge #5 and Challenge #6 crystals.

-   Please note that the two crystals may still spawn together. After a few seconds, the Challenge #5 crystal should automatically despawn.

-   Fixed a bug which caused the ghosts from Challenge #9: Darkan to stick around during Challenge #10: Shandra Manaya.

-   The ghosts may remain until Challenge #10: Shandra Manaya is spawned in which they will vanish in fear of the Argon Queen.

-   You can now bank your Shandra Manaya Quills.

Design Note: After our [previous change to the "last chance" buff](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4pIAfWOc8kJf6Z4rUCqY4SaOqaGGt-W5Gwm6_xmz5w/edit#heading=h.zcfz50sa5kio), we've kept a close eye on our player's ability to continue kiting bosses for, in some cases, over 6 minutes. While amusing, this isn't what we intended with the buff, and we'll continue ramping its potency up until it has the impact we desire.

#### Shadow Sanguinary (Hard)

-   Nightmare Imperator's final timer now starts at 20%, and lasts 130 seconds.

-   This has been changed from starting at 25% with a 120 second timer.

-   Increased the Vanguard Reward's Piece of Dakuryon's Experiment from 4 → 10.

Design Note: We've noticed a trend where many parties challenging Shadow Sanguinary (Hard) only defeat the first boss repeatedly. This situation isn't ideal, and we've identified a few factors that may cause this to be the case. One of the things we feel is that the last boss, Imperator, can be too unforgiving with the timer at the end. These changes will alleviate some of the overbearing difficulty parties were facing and hopefully make running the entire dungeon feel better.

#### Antaroth's Abyss (Hard) & The Plexus (Hard)

-   Now drops both Essence of Power and Monster's Core.

#### Antaroth's Abyss (Normal), Shadow Sanguinary (Normal), Timescape, Velik's Sanctuary

-   Added 50 Refined Mana Essence to the Vanguard Request Rewards.

-   Antaroth's Abyss (Normal)

-   Antaroth additionally drops the following loot:

-   Lightning Orb (5 stacks of 4)

-   Dice of Destiny (3 stacks of 1) 

-   Added the following materials into the Vanguard Request Reward:

-   Ruined Medallion (5x)

-   Lightning Orb (4x)

-   Dice of Destiny (1x)

-   Shadow Sanguinary (Normal)

-   Imperator additionally drops the following loot:

-   Fragment of Soul (5 stacks of 4)

-   Dice of Destiny (3 stacks of 1)

-   Added the following materials into the Vanguard Request Reward:

-   Metallic Scale (5x)

-   Fragment of Soul (4x)

-   Dice of Destiny (1x)

-   Timescape

-   Added the following material into the Vanguard Request Reward:

-   Corrupted Beryl (5x)

-   Increased the amount of materials you get from the Vanguard Request Reward:

-   Lightning Orb 4 → 6

-   Velik's Sanctuary

-   Added the following material into the Vanguard Request Reward:

-   Veil's Flame (5x)

-   Increased the amount of materials you get from the Vanguard Request Reward:

-   Fragment of Soul 4 → 6

Design Note: We want to improve the variety of options players have when farming for Dormant gear, rather than just spamming Timescape and Velik's Sanctuary (Normal). We're hoping to strike a balance between making Antaroth's Abyss (Normal) and Shadow Sanguinary (Normal) viable options to play, without killing Timescape and Velik's Sanctuary (Normal) instance matching.

#### Leaderboards

-   Updated the rewards for all leaderboard dungeons.

-   Rank 1:

-   Intact Bloodshard Box (10x)

-   (Dreadspire Only) Shandra Manaya Quill (1x)

-   Rank 2~3:

-   Intact Bloodshard Box (7x)

-   Rank 4~10:

-   Intact Bloodshard Box (5x)

-   Rank 11~20:

-   Intact Bloodshard Box (3x)

-   Rank 21~50:

-   Shattered Bloodshard Box (3x)

-   All pet box amounts have been kept the same.

[PvE] Gear Changes
------------------

#### Titanic Vyrsk

-   Increases Damage by 4.9% → 1.96%

-   Reduces Attack Speed by 5% → 2.5%

-   (Swift Titanic Vyrsk) Reduces Attack Speed by 4% → 1.5%

-   Increases Cooldown by all skills under 60 seconds by 2.3% → 1.15%

Design Note: As stated in the [patch notes when we added Titanic Vyrsks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15jjPdQ6IAVzPMxaBZ7bkcIPlm2Hr0SA6nKSHDkdZvVs/edit#heading=h.ec7m4fm01zvl) these crystals were not intended to be a direct upgrade to the existing Vyrsks in any way. Now that more people are playing with these Vyrsks and trying them out, we've noticed that they're overperforming our expectations and design intentions. As such, they've been tuned down. We'll continue to keep a close eye on them to ensure that they perform as expected.

#### Annihilation, Dark Light, Kaia's Fury and Kaia's Wisdom

-   Now has a 100% success rate when enchanting from +0 to +15.

-   Reduced the Essence of Power and Monster's Core cost when upgrading to Dormant by about 40%.

[PvP] Miscellaneous
-------------------

-   Kronox, the PvP Mystery Merchant, is now permanently available outside of the Velika Outskirts Hall.

-   The following items can now be banked and discarded:

-   Dawn Box

-   Dusk Box

-   Kumas's Box

-   Tantibus's Box

-   Increased the knockdown and stagger resistances of Enraged Kumas.

Class Changes
-------------

#### Slayer

-   Unsheathe

-   [PvE]  Reduced base cooldown from 170 → 160 seconds

Design Note: We've noticed that Slayer struggles to sync Unsheathe in high-intensity fights due to the overall higher-intensity of the dungeon lineup. This change will push Slayer in the right direction: making it easier to sync Unsheathe even with skill cast downtime as you dodge or perform mechanics. We'll keep our eyes on this class and make additional changes if required.

#### Priest

-   Zenobia's Vortex

-   On hit, reduces the cooldown of Edict of Judgment by an additional 0.4 seconds with a Brawler Tank using Haymaker's Resonance Advancement.

Design Note: Like Slayer, we've noticed that Priest can get punished extremely hard, notably with Brawler Tank as it doesn't provide Attack Speed and Cooldown Reduction compared to Lancer and Warrior Tank. That, paired with the overall high-intensity dungeon lineup this patch provides, proves too punishing for our design intentions. We'll continue to monitor Priest's performance and make additional changes if required.
