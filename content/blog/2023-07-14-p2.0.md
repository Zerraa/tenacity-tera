-   This new gear, referred to as "Bloodshard Gear" has a few unique basic attributes:

-   Can equip Bloodshard Crystals, referred to as "Bloodshards", based on its grade.

-   Has double cooldown reduction and enrage rolls.

-   Upgrading the gear will increase its grade.

-   There are four grades: Dormant, Gleaming, Resplendent, Perfected

-   Classes can only equip the correct gear for them.

-   For example, the Gunner can no longer equip Physical metal gear.

#### Crafting Profession: Armory

-   Used to craft materials to upgrade your Bloodshard gear or convert update materials.

-   Recipes are available from Dungeons or purchased from the Trade Broker.

[PvE] Titanic Vyrsks
--------------------

-   New options for Vyrsks have been added: Titanic Keen, Powerful, and Swift!

-   We introduced them as a way to slow gameplay down, allowing players to trade some of their attack speed for raw damage if they prefer.

-   They are not designed to be "better" or "stronger". Instead, they have been designed to give players more freedom to adjust and tune their gameplay to their preference.

-   These must be equipped to Level 65 or higher Earrings or Rings.

-   If you want to know what they do, you'll have to obtain them in-game and find out for yourself!

-   Each quest will give a book explaining the basics of each battleground, including common gameplay terms where applicable, strategies, and the goal of each battleground.

Class Changes
-------------

Design Note: This patch introduces significant changes to other aspects of the game, such as new gear, items, and returning dungeons. We anticipate all of these will have a strong impact on class balance. Therefore, we have decided to avoid making too many changes in this patch, and instead observe how the classes perform in the new environment. We expect that the damage output of each class will vary as players experiment with different strategies and adapt to the changes and new dungeon roster. We will monitor balance closely and make adjustments as needed when we have a clearer picture of the game state.

#### Archer

-   Gust Arrow

-   Reduced range from 40 → 20 meters.

-   Reduced the range Gust Arrow hits behind you.

-   Enters cooldown immediately when charging.

-   Charging the skill now provides invincibility.

#### Berserker

-   [PvE] Increased damage by 1.5%.

-   Bloodlust

-   [PvE] Increased cooldown from 73 → 80 seconds.

-   Fiery Rage

-   [PvE] Increased cooldown from 45 → 80 seconds.

-   Unleash

-   [PvE] Increased cooldown from 260 → 285 seconds.

-   Intimidation

-   Generates 50% additional aggro against enraged monsters.

-   Increases damage to monsters by 5% when attacking from the front or side.

-   This change requires a Bloodshard weapon equipped.

-   The quest which unlocks Intimidation was converted to a purple ("Important") quest to improve visibility.

Design Note: This is not a nerf to the class. The changes to Berserker's cooldowns are to account for Bloodshard gear having double cooldown reduction and enrage rolls.

#### Brawler

-   Growing Fury's Irregular Advancement

-   Increases damage to monsters by 5% when attacking from behind (requires a Bloodshard weapon to be equipped).

-   Fixed a bug where Retaliate was affected by Growing Fury on Human Female.

#### Mystic

-   Arunic Release

-   Heals immediately.

-   Amount healed is now visible.

-   Healing now scales on gear.

-   Restores 1/6 (1 mote) or 1/3 (2 motes) of the target's MP.

-   Boomerang Pulse

-   Reduced healing by 25%.

-   Contagion

-   Now increases damage taken by 5.5% rather than reducing Endurance by 4%.

-   Increased healing by 50%.

#### Reaper

-   [PvE] Reduced damage by 4.2%.

-   Increased new character inventory slots from 40 → 48 slots.

-   This change was made as Reapers do not have access to the Inventory Trick quest like other classes.

#### Valkyrie

-   [PvE] Increased damage by 2.5%.

-   Dream Slash

-   Reduced range from 30 → 20 meters.

-   Godsfall

-   [PvE] Increased cooldown from 240 → 275 seconds.

-   Titansbane

-   [PvE] Increased cooldown from 335 → 380 seconds.

Design Note: This is not a nerf to the class. The changes to Valkyrie's cooldowns are to account for Bloodshard gear having double cooldown reduction and enrage rolls.

#### Warrior

-   Blade Waltz

-   Refactored the skill to fix lockout and improve other edge case issues.

-   Rain of Blows

-   [PvE] Reduced base damage by 10.5%.

-   [PvP] No longer has a chance to knock down.

#### Miscellaneous

-   All classes with the "Bloodlust" effect now have a normalized average value.

-   For those unaware, the "Bloodlust" effect was a fairly hidden mechanic where specific classes and skills did more damage based on how low the target's HP was.

-   Increased maximum aggro by 100 times.

-   [PvE] Reduced all healing by 20%.

New Systems
-----------

#### Shields on HP Bar

-   A new bar will appear over your HP whenever you gain a shield effect, such as a Divine Protection or Kaia's Shield.

-   Depending on the type of shield, the effect displays differently.

-   The gauge will reduce when you take damage and be removed when your shields have expired or been depleted.

-   With this change, HP and other bars such as Stamina and Mana have been changed to appear slanted rather than "straight cut".

-   This was done to fit the gauge bar UI more naturally.

-   Please note that this change will mean your HP/MP bar mods will need to be updated.

-   Use the item to reset you and your party's cooldowns but incurs a silence for a short period.

-   Affects nearby party members.

-   This item cannot be used inside Civil Unrest.
