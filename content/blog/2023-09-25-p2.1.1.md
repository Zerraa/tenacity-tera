#### Dark Reach Citadel (Hard)

-   The cage created by Nightmare Theropath now despawns correctly when Theropath is defeated.

-------------

#### Archer

-   Note: To reiterate, you do not need to select this line on your weapon or the other ones that were added in the previous patch. They automatically apply and do not need to be selected.

-   Fixed an issue where tradeable Dawn and Dusk Jewelry from Battleground Trophy could not be liberated.

#### Civil Unrest: Colossal Ruins

-   Disabled personal costumes.

#### Arun's Legacy Mission Board

-   Added Bloodshard Boxes available for purchase at Friendly reputation rank or higher.

-   Shattered Bloodshard Box costs 50 Reputation Credits

-   Intact Bloodshard Box costs 150 Reputation Credits
[PvE] Dormant Brooch & Mask
---------------------------

#### Dormant Brooch & Bloodpact Skill

A new Brooch is available with updated functionality. The Brooch and the bloodpact skill can be acquired by completing the [Blood for Blood] story quest obtained at Item Level 501 or higher. This Brooch can be upgraded three times, just like the gear, unlocking a new line of stats each time. These lines are pre-determined and cannot be changed.

This Brooch and its skill is slightly different and as such, may require some explanation:

-   Using the new Brooch will apply a 160 second cooldown where you cannot be affected by any other Brooch. This applies after the Bloodpact Skill ends. 

-   You can either slot the Brooch (item) or slot the bloodpact (skill) to your hotbar. It's up to you which you prefer, or if you want both on your hotbar as they have different pros and cons:

-   You can use the Brooch (item) while stunned.

-   You cannot use the bloodpact (skill) while stunned.

-   Note that neither of these show the correct cooldown. You'll need to look at your debuff to determine your correct cooldown.

-   The main benefit of having it work this way is that the skill can be reset using Unstable Bomb of Cooling or when defeating dungeon bosses.

-   The bloodpact skill reduces PvP damage by 90% to prevent use in PvP.

#### Dormant Mask

You can receive a new mask from the same [Blood for Blood] quest that was previously mentioned. Just like the Brooch, this mask can also be upgraded three times.

[PvE] Dungeon Changes
---------------------

#### Opened Dungeons

The following dungeons are opening their doors:

-   Velik's Sanctuary (Hard)

-   Lumikan's Dream

-   Lumikan's Dream (Hard)

#### Closer Look: Velik's Sanctuary (Hard)

While the name is familiar, the dungeon has multiple changes to deviate from what you may remember. New challenges along with new rewards await within.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/pAlsMsiAVLh2rwFPqjqqZfj82sQc6JDfP6zhEVF9IM_OOWFshZtICsd7mS620Jl8L5UFL855tPwpgkQVe2FGyuzw0sZfJcPUTL1F3PYPYNcXRCFZDhwFD_3hk7Jtr9L9PPCbskvaDDjegfV_43kFbBs)

#### Closer Look: Lumikan's Dream

Lumikan's Dream has an extremely important quest titled [Blood for Blood], leading the player into Lumikan's Dream (Normal). This quest is unlocked when your Item Level is 501 or higher, and can be started by speaking with Hasmina in Balderon.

As a reward for your endeavor, you receive the following quest rewards:

-   Lumikan Wing (5x)

-   Essence of Power (10x)

-   Monster's Core (10x)

-   Dormant Mask

-   Dormant Brooch

-   Bloodpact Skill

Additionally, we wanted to fix multiple annoyances with the Lumikan's Dream you're all familiar with. The following adjustments have been applied to alleviate these concerns:

-   Valkyrie's Godsfall no longer causes them to die during her cage mechanic.

-   Her skull mechanic now shows the timer on her abnormality bar.

-   This change was made so that players are not forced to either enable screen shake or use a third party mod to complete the dungeon.

Class Changes
-------------

#### Archer

-   Windsong

-   Reduced final Cooldown by 1s (now 78.5s).

-   Radiant Arrow

-   Increased overcharge bonus damage from 5.9% → 12.4% per tick.

-   Penetrating Arrow

-   Increased overcharged damage bonus from 9.2% → 15% per tick.

Design Note: We're aware that Archer might need some additional buffs. However, we need to see what the impact increased overcharge damage bonus does in real dungeons before moving forward with more changes.

#### Berserker

-   Thunder Strike

-   Increased overcharge bonus damage from 18.89% → 20.79% per tick.

-   Cyclone

-   Increased overcharge bonus damage from 20.4% → 22.46% per tick.

Design Note: We've noticed the massive unpopularity for Berserker's Unleash, and we do hear you. We're slowly moving forward with Berserker changes, but we didn't have the time to do them properly in this patch. Like a few others, Berserker falls into the category of unknown potential due to it not being a top performing class at the moment. All we can ask is for you to remain patient as change is coming.

#### Brawler

-   Growing Fury (Irregular)

-   Increased damage while affected by Growing Fury (Irregular) by about 10%.

-   Now uses a previously unused icon to more easily differentiate it.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aQbpc0vtebVjKDCorDdZs6_CpdqpSUHWAo4Zy36dfiJ50yfo4ff4LK5c6FisIuNrj2QM-8Q11sXz6Ki_3Yht_z-j7DU0iQRRh2qLoQEbjm_M0XPm249ucwewaXHHYmbZTAgpypruxWR_nKHF9ENfdP0)

-   Haymaker (Weak Spot Thrust)

-   Now affects both back and side rather than just back damage.

-   Counter's Glyph of Powerlink

-   Can no longer be activated while using Growing Fury (Irregular).

Design Note: Brawler DPS has not been performing to our standard when compared to other classes since 2.0, and various flaws have contributed to this fast. Powerlinked Counter is entirely dependent on the boss you're fighting, where if you couldn't find the opening to block an attack, you did far less damage. Likewise, Haymaker's Weak Spot Thrust advancement requires you to be able to hit in the back or you'd lose damage, resulting in far more punishment than other classes for side hitting. We've attempted to mitigate these factors as best as possible, but even with these mitigated Brawler DPS had no hope of keeping up with the upper limit of the rest of the roster. As such, their overall damage has been increased to compensate for potential damage loss.

#### Mystic

-   Arun's Vitae & Arun's Tear

-   Reduced base cooldown from 11 → 5s.

-   Arunic Release

-   [PvE] Reduced base cooldown from 11 → 8.3s.

-   Reduced healing by 25%.

-   Thrall of Protection

-   Shield now applies 0.3s faster.

Design Note: We're hoping that this will bring back the mote-centric Mystic playstyle for those who desire it, while making it possible to stack more motes than you can explode with Arunic Release. This will lead to better Mystic self healing due to Arun's Vitae self-healing glyph.

#### Ninja

-   [PvE] Increased damage by 5%.

-   [PvE] Increased damage bonus while affected by Adrenaline Rush by 2%.

-   Burning Heart

-   Made internal changes to Burning Heart to alleviate bugs relating to its cooldown.

-   Cyclic Chi

-   Now increases Ranged Skill Critical Hit Chance by 30% → 50% to match the non-Inner Harmony version.

-   Decoy Jutsu

-   Reduced base cooldown from 10 → 9 seconds.

-   Impact Bomb (Corrosive Bomb)

-   Changed the effect as follows: Increases the caster's Attack Speed by 1% for 15 seconds, stacking up to 5 times. The duration can be refreshed.

-   Inner Harmony

-   Reverted the 4% damage reduction.

Design Note: Ninja has been vastly underperforming our metrics, so we've made a few changes that will make them more viable. We've also changed Corrosive Bomb from its damage boost for the party to a personal boost which should result in a net higher damage for the player.

#### Priest

-   [PvE] Reduced damage by 45%.

-   Divine Charge

-   Increased buff duration to 22s.

-   This makes it possible to refresh the buff, leading to 100% uptime being possible.

-   Triple Nemesis

-   Increased range from 18 → 25m.

Design Note: Despite Priest being extremely strong, we've heard from the community that the execution still feels off. The increased range to Triple Nemesis gives Priest an additional ranged option rather than being forced to use Holy Burst to engage enemies. As for Divine Charge, we've noticed that it can be hard to sync with other buffs properly, often ending early into burn periods and being reapplied at the end or after the burn window. The changes aim to make Priest more consistent and enjoyable without changing its playstyle. Combined with these new changes, Priest's personal damage had to come down as it was already extremely high on top of its very strong utility.

#### Reaper

Integrity Note: Unfortunately, we must admit something here and now: we know that some players have been abusing exploits that result in more damage. This, of course, happens on multiple classes but it affected Reaper most. We've been improving things internally and are now taking further precautions in maintaining the integrity of the game, starting here and now with Reaper. With these changes, we want to rebalance the class to be playable for those who aren't using exploits while tightening our grip on the use of exploits. Our hope is to result in more accurate client-server data and harsher punishments for those who abuse cheats going forward.

-   [PvE] Reduced damage by 2%.

-   Increased Reaper's Attack Speed by 10% when equipping a Bloodshard weapon.

-   Binding Scythes

-   No longer requires 50 stacks to deal maximum damage, now just requiring a single stack.

-   Fixed an issue where two or more Reaper's Binding Scythes would not work at once.

-   [PvP] Reduced damage by 50% to account for the aforementioned stack change.

-   Dark Harvest

-   Increased the window where Enhanced Shadow Burst and Enhanced Sundering Strike are active from 3 → 3.25s.

-   Death Spiral

-   Reduced base cooldown from 6 → 4.5s.

-   Grim Strike

-   Reduced damage by 15%.

-   Keen Grim Strike

-   Changed effect from "triples crit factor" → "doubles crit chance".

-   Retribution

-   After a successful hit of Retribution, all attacks are considered back attacks for 5 seconds.

-   Shadow Burst

-   Can now cancel the animation of Shadow Reaping to prevent ghosting.

-   Shadow Reaping

-   Reduced base cooldown from 80 → 78s.

-   Force EP

-   Increased Power from 10 → 18.

-   Quick Shadow Reaping

-   Increased Attack Speed from 4% → 6% per stack when hitting a monster.

-   Shrouded Escape

-   Reduced base cooldown from 70 → 68s.

Design Note: I know: the initial reaction to the 2% damage reduction is likely a scoff. Hear us out though: our main goal with these changes is to make Reaper more enjoyable to play. To do so, we had to reduce Reaper's overall damage slightly, especially as the quality of life changes and massively increased attack speed make up for that loss in damage. Though Grim Strike's damage has been significantly reduced, the skill's critical hit rate has been adjusted upwards. It should provide the same overall damage while being more consistent to use. Lastly, the adjustments to BInding Scythes will also fix issues and make Reaper more reliable- no longer will you be punished for the boss deciding to move: you'll always be dealing max damage.

#### Sorcerer

-   Implosion

-   Reduced base cooldown from 237 → 232s.

Design Note: Although Sorcerer is very strong, this change aims to make Implosion less strict on mechanic heavy fights. We don't anticipate it'll make the class any "stronger", but instead make getting your Implosion off at the right time on hard fights a bit easier.

#### Slayer

-   Energy Rush Passive

-   [PvE] No longer has multiple stacks, now providing the maximum effect with a single stack.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2hRcnAQYTvOrgps4liPGJbdCycNvvj1LvfwomTUbClI1WCVO5qihf9n978vOyoorj3jSdpOnJS5ZFSzZXizC3lTe02Avmi8ILYtqqVsOq4Figpmx2duJteDsOrWt80J_7DsArqQXDC9Y1Ls0dksyt5M)

-   In Cold Blood

-   Reduced final Cooldown by 1s (now 78.5s).

Design Note: The changes to Energy Rush give Slayers immediate Attack Speed at the start of their burn instead of a slow, windup Attack Speed should alleviate some of the clunkiness with the class. We'll continue to keep an eye on Slayer as we do anticipate that it might need additional changes, but this should make the class feel better to play in the interim.

#### Valkyrie

-   [PvE] Increased damage by 1.5%.

-   Godsfall

-   Reduced base cooldown from 275 → 262s.

Design Note: Similarly to Berserker, we're aware of the opinion surrounding this class. It's both clunky and punishing on mechanic heavy fights. We do have changes in mind to fix this, but we need more time to do them correctly without rushing or applying sloppy fixes. For now, syncing Godsfall with brooch easier will hopefully be enough while we finalize our ideas and get them applied.

[PvE] Gear Changes

-   Reduces Damage Dealt by 1.28% → 0.8%.

-   Rare

-   Increases Attack Speed by 4% → 4.8%.

-   Reduces Damage Dealt by 1.92% → 1.2%.

-   Superior

-   Increases Attack Speed by 5.33% → 6.4%.

-   Reduces Damage Dealt by 2.56% → 1.6%.

-   Mythic

-   Increases Attack Speed by 6.66% → 8%.

-   Reduces Damage Dealt by 3.2% → 2%.

-   Enabled Duo Queue.

-   Increased Mystic's healing point gain by 20%.

-   Lowered Slayer's point gain by 10%.

-   Lowered Warrior's point gain by 30%.

Design Note: Slayer and Warrior's point gain have been reduced as they've been gaining far more points than other classes. Likewise, Mystic wasn't gaining enough points for healing as we'd have liked. We'll continue to monitor the overall performance of classes in Gridiron and make further adjustments as necessary.

-   Fixed the issue where Kelsaik's DPS buff was stackable.
[PvE] Dungeon Changes
---------------------

-   When a boss dies or is reset, all dead players will be revived.

-   This does not include Revived Dakuryon (Velik's Sanctuary) or Nightmare Revived Dakuryon (Velik's Sanctuary (Hard)) as he immediately becomes aggressive when players are in range.

-   All bosses have been adjusted and should no longer resist important debuffs such as a Healer's endurance debuff or Brawler's Rhythmic Blows debuff.

-   We'll continue to monitor this, so please report it if you see it happen! When reporting, make sure the boss actually resisted the attack and that you didn't ghost or simply miss.

Miscellaneous
-------------

#### Changes
