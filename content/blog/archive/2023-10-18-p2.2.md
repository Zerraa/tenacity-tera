Class Changes
-------------

#### Archer

-   [PvE]  Increased damage by 2%.

-   Breakaway Bolt's Glyph of Powerlink

-   Has been moved to Sequential Fire with the same Glyph Point cost.

-   Poison Arrow's Glyph of Blaze

-   Has been moved to Wind Walk with the same Glyph Point cost.

-   Rain of Arrows

-   [PvP] Reduced damage during Windsong by 15%.

-   Resists knockdown while casting.

-   Thunderbolt

-   [PvP] Reload EP now only affects monsters.

#### Berserker

-   [PvE] Increased damage by 2%.

-   Bloodlust

-   Added the Apex Urgency visual effect when active.

#### Lancer

-   Divine Protection

-   [PvP ─ Battlegrounds] Can no longer be used.

-   Onslaught

-   Changed the damage distribution to deal the same amount of damage per hit, rather than the skill's damage increasing for the final three hits.

-   Overall skill damage has not been changed.

-   Spring Attack

-   Doubled innate crit chance.

-   Reduced base skill damage by 33.5%.

-   [PvP] Doubled skill damage.

Design Note: Spring Attack is a skill with an infamously low crit rate, so doubling its crit chance will make it both more consistent and deal more damage. Instead of reducing its damage by half to compensate, we left Spring Attack in a slightly stronger place than before to promote a more balanced playstyle for Lancers. 

#### Mystic

-   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Equalized gear now reduces damage taken by an additional 10%.

-   Summon: Group

-   Increased base cooldown from 10 → 30 minutes.

-   [PvP ─ Civil Unrest] Removed debuff which increases Summon: Group cooldown.

-   Thrall of Life

-   The thrall now spawns sooner.

#### Priest

-   [PvE]  Increased damage by 15%.

-   Mass Divine Intervention

-   Reduced range to 19 meters.

-   Summon: Group

-   Increased base cooldown from 10 → 30 minutes.

-   [PvP ─ Civil Unrest] Removed debuff which increases Summon: Group cooldown.

-   Zenobia's Vortex

-   Can no longer affect Lumikan's Nightmare Minions.

#### Reaper

-   [PvE] Increased damage by 1%.

-   Increased innate crit chance by 10%.

-   Shadow Reaping

-   Quick Shadow Reaping stacks now provide 30% Attack Speed.

-   Quick Shadow Reaping now only stacks once.

#### Slayer

-   [PvE]  Increased damage by 1%.

-   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Equalized gear no longer provides 7.2% Cooldown Reduction.

-   Fury Strike

-   No longer scales on the inverse of your HP, now dealing the maximum damage.

-   Increased innate crit rate against monsters by 50%.

-   [PvP] Reduced damage by 65%.

-   In Cold Blood

-   Added the Apex Urgency visual effect when active.

-   Overhand Strike

-   Increased innate crit chance against monsters during In Cold Blood by 25%.

-   Reduced base cooldown from 4 → 3.5s.

Design Note: (PvP) Fury Strike no longer scaling on HP gives the skill an overwhelmingly powerful presence. Slayer is already a divisive class when it comes to its overall prowess, so we've reduced Fury Strike's damage to bring its performance to as close as possible to pre-buff.

#### Sorcerer

-   Nova

-   Changed the effective range of Nova from 13 → 15.2 meters.

-   This was done by changing the skill's radius from 5 → 7 meters and the skill's offset distance from 7 → 8.2 meters resulting in an effective range increase of 2.2m.
