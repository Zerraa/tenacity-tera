[PvE] Dungeon Changes
---------------------

#### Demon's Wheel

-   Demoros

-   Reduced audio to not cause players to be at-risk of early onset hearing loss.

-   Reduced HP from 45 billion → 41 billion.

-   The following attacks can now be dodged with "special iframes" (such as Smoke Bomb and Warp Barrier):

-   Red / Blue explosive circles

-   Red AoE when colored dice are summoned

-   You can no longer dodge the small blue and big red coin circles during Phase 2 / Intermission with "special iframes".

-   This was done to reduce the chance of accidentally dodging the coins.

-   Demoros' Grey Dice

-   Reduced HP from 560 million → 400 million.

-   Enrage value reduced from 56 million → 20 million.

-   Critical resistance reduced from 50 → 0.

-   Demoros' Colored Dice's shield has been reduced:

-   Phase 1: 225 million → 150 million

-   Phase 2: 225 million → 125 million

-   Critical resistance reduced from 50 → 0.

#### Grotto of Lost Souls (Hard)

-   Nightmare Nedra

-   You can no longer survive the wipe mechanic with Guardian Barrier.

-   We did not intend for the wipe mechanic to be survivable.

-   Nightmare Kylos

-   Fixed an issue which caused Valkyrie's Evasion and Reaper's Retribution to not work on the wave attack.

-   The triple wing front attack's damage has been reduced slightly.

-   Tanks were taking a small amount of bleed through with this attack, which could cause them to die at low HP- even during perfect blocks.

-   The wave attack's damage has been increased from 80% → 120%.

-   Nightmare Kylos' Orbs

-   Now have a visible HP bar above them.

-   Critical resistance reduced from 210 → 0.

#### Shadow Sanguinary (Hard)

-   The mobs between bosses have had their ATK and HP reduced by 50%.

-   Nightmare Dakuryon

-   Reduced HP from 38 billion → 34 billion.

-   Nightmare Dakuryon's Minions

-   Reduced HP by 75%.

-   Nightmare Imperator

-   Reduced HP from 57.5 billion → 52.5 billion.

-   Nightmare Imperator's Minions

-   Reduced HP by 50%.

Class Changes
-------------

#### Berserker

-   Fearsome Shout

-   Reduced duration of fear from 5.5 → 4 seconds.

-   Inescapable Doom

-   Reduced duration of slow from 6 → 4 seconds.

-   Glyph of Lingering is no longer available

#### Mystic

-   [PvP ─ Fraywind Canyon] Reduced overall healing by 20%.

#### Priest

-   [PvP ─ Fraywind Canyon] Reduced overall healing by 20%.

#### Reaper

-   Whipsaw

-   Glyph of the Pump now requires a minimum of 5% → 10.6% HP to activate the effect.

-   This was done to address a niche issue in Grotto of Lost Souls (Hard) where a Reaper that cannot be healed could cast Whipsaw with less than 10.5% HP and kill themselves.

[Event] Gourdo's Ghoulish Gala
------------------------------

Event Period: October 19th, 2023 ~ November 21st, 2023

-   Harvest Festival Hall can no longer be Instanced Matched, nor does it show on the character's profile.

-   The following quests now provide 5 [Event] Gourdo's Gala Coin upon completion.

-   Cannons and Candy

-   The Party Bouncer

[Event] Battle Pass: Season III
-------------------------------

Event Period: October 19th, 2023 ~ December 19th, 2023

Design Note: We've been keeping an eye on your feedback and we've made some adjustments based on it. Overall, both PvE and PvP unanimously agreed that this event was too grindy.

#### PvE

-   Novice missions have received an overhaul:

-   Now use the correct blue mission icon.

-   The following missions are now available, and award 1 Novice fragment upon completion:

-   Antaroth's Abyss

-   Dreadspire Lower Floors

-   Shadow Sanguinary

-   All aforementioned missions are available from both the [Battle Pass] Novice Dungeon Mission Ticket and the [Battle Pass] Novice Mission Random Box.

-   The [Battle Pass] Novice Mission Random Box has been adjusted as follows:

-   Missions removed:

-   Demon's Wheel

-   Dreadspire Middle Floors

-   Velik's Hold (Hard)

-   Red Refuge (Hard)

-   Missions added:

-   Antaroth's Abyss

-   Shadow Sanguinary

-   The following Novice missions now provide two Novice fragments upon completion:

-   Demon's Wheel

-   Dreadspire Middle Floors

-   Velik's Hold (Hard)

-   Red Refuge (Hard)

-   To reiterate: these missions are now only available from the [Battle Pass] Novice Dungeon Mission Ticket due to them giving two Novice fragments upon completion rather than one... They aren't available from the box so as to not introduce RNG into those racing for the server's first titles, while still increasing the available pool of Novice fragments to certain dungeons. You will only get lower, one-fragment missions from the random box as previously mentioned.

-   All Expert missions now award two Expert fragments upon completion, rather than one.

Design Note: This patch will help mitigate common criticisms for both Novice and Expert without locking additional fragments behind RNG to those racing for the server's first title. We'll keep our eye on your feedback and how these changes positively or negatively affect the experience, and make additional adjustments as necessary... Of course, we're also more than well aware of the elephant in the room: Demon's Wheel. We know it's a divisive topic, but we want to see what impact the nerfs make on the public perception of this dungeon- if any- before taking any bigger steps regarding it. 

#### PvP

-   Adjusted [Battle Pass] PvP Mission Box to give the following:

-   1x [Battle Pass] Mission: Fraywind Canyon 

-   3x [Battle Pass] PvP Mission Ticket

-   Champion's Skyring now provides two PvP fragments, rather than one.

-   The following missions now provide three PvP Fragments, rather than one:

-   Gridiron

-   Shore Hold

-   Fraywind Canyon now provides five PvP Fragments, rather than one.

Design Note: The primary issue that we've heard is that completing eight missions takes far too long. As such, we've gone ahead and reduced the amount of missions you get in total, while drastically increasing the fragment payout. This serves to make it less grindy by both costing less time per day, and requiring less wins. We'll make further adjustments as necessary.

[PvP] Civil Unrest: Colossal Ruins
----------------------------------

-   Adjusted Argentus, King of the Jungle as follows:

-   Reduced HP and Defense to match other Civil Unrest BAMs.

-   No longer performs the charge attack.

-   Removed attack guide.

-   Doubled reset distance.

-   Changed spawn announcement to correctly state Colossal Ruins.

[PvP] Battleground Changes
--------------------------

#### Champion's Skyring

-   Reduced the cooldown of the Battleground from 2 → 1 minute.

#### Fraywind Canyon

-   Increased minimum and maximum healers to 4.

-   Reduced Teralith and Naga HP by 25%.

-   Set the Teralith spawn timer to 2:40.

-   This is 4:20 after the Battleground initially starts.

-   Changed the amount of points from pyres:

-   1 Pyre vs 0 Pyres has been increased from 3 → 4 points per second.

-   2 Pyres vs 1 Pyre has been increased from 3 → 4 points per second.

-   3 Pyres vs 0 Pyres has been reduced from 8 → 5 points per second.

-   Reduced the cooldown of the Battleground from 10 → 3 minutes.

Design Note: We've reduced Mystic and Priest's healing power by 20% to compensate for an additional healer in the battleground. While we believe this will improve the matchmaking experience, we'll keep an eye on how it affects overall gameplay and adjust as necessary. We've also made some changes to the points gained from pyres to make the game revolve less solely around pyres. Of course, we're keeping a close eye on both Fraywind games and player's feedback, so please let us know what you think of these changes.

[PvP] Content Changes
---------------------

#### Dawn & Dusk Jewelry

Design Note: One of the main points of feedback we've been getting surrounding Dawn & Dusk Jewelry is that it essentially kills playing on alts. Our solution to this is to allow you to dismantle Dawn & Dusk Accessories to acquire accessory sets for other characters on your account.

-   Ring: 25x Salvaged Ring Shard

-   Earring: 25x Salvaged Earring Shard

-   Necklace: 50x Salvaged Necklace Shard

-   Circlet: 50x Salvaged Circlet Shard

-   You can right-click on the Salvage Shards to open a Salvage Shard Shop:

-   Ring Eclipse Box

-   Contains 20x Luminshade Ring Token

-   Cost: 50x Salvaged Ring Shard

-   Earring Eclipse Box

-   Contains 20x Luminshade Earring Token

-   Cost: 50x Salvaged Earring Shard

-   Necklace Eclipse Box

-   Contains 20x Luminshade Necklace Token

-   Cost: 50x Salvaged Necklace Shard

-   Circlet Eclipse Box

-   Contains 20x Luminshade Circlet Token

-   Cost: 50x Salvaged Circlet Shard

-   Luminshade Tokens can be used to redeem Dawn & Dusk Accessories at a 1:1 conversion ratio.

-   Accessories obtained from Luminshade Tokens cannot be liberated or traded.

#### Sky Castles

-   Replaced the Cosmetic Merchant (Syline) with a Reputation Merchant (Kaia).
