Class Changes
-------------

#### Ninja

-   While affected by a Lancer's Adrenaline Rush, the following skills receive 13.3% → 6.24% CDR:

-   Boomerang Shuriken

-   Burning Heart

-   [Click here](https://tenacity-tera.eu/en/patch-note/2023-02-06-p1.6/) if you need a refresher on how Adrenaline Rush works on MT after Patch 1.6.

Design Note: While this change does indeed reduce Ninja's overall damage potential in some scenarios, it was unfortunately necessary to prevent an unintended behavior with Inner Harmony and Lancer's Adrenaline Rush. This change will fix the issue, and we'll keep an eye on how Ninja performs and make further adjustments as necessary.

[PvP] Battleground Changes
--------------------------

#### Leaderboards

-   The current leaderboard season has been extended from November 5th → November 12th.

Design Note: This change was made as there's an ongoing Fraywind Canyon event which lasts for 31 days. [Click here](https://discord.com/channels/809082900527579199/1164288249620070470/1164503447203221544) to view more info on our Discord!
