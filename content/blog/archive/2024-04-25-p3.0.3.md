[PvE] Veilbound Gear
--------------------

-   Adjusted the base success rate when enchanting from +9 to +12.

-   Veilbound +9 → +10's base success rate: 10% → 16%

-   Veilbound +10 → +11's base success rate: 7.5% → 12%

-   Veilbound +11 → +12's base success rate: 5% → 8%

Design Note: This patch aims to address the most tedious part of the Veilbound gearing process first: advancing from +9 to +12. By increasing the base success rates in this tier, gearing will be more reliable and less dependent on fail correction. These changes, along with others detailed below, are designed to make this content tier more engaging. Further adjustments may be made in future patches.

[PvE] Dungeon Changes
---------------------

#### Draakon Arena (Hard)

-   Nightmare Kalligar

-   Increased the distance required to trigger Nightmare Kalligar's range check from 8 → 13 meters.

#### Akalath Quarantine

-   Akalath Kashir

-   Reduced HP by 10%.

-   No longer performs the random "flash" attack.

-   Note: Akalath Kashir will still perform a "flash" attack when resurrect is cast!

-   Shifted the timing of the "hunt" mechanic to occur after 1:30.

Design Note: Akalath Quarantine receives the most complaints, particularly due to Akalath Kashir. The changes to Akalath Kashir's fight aim to make the overall dungeon more engaging and enjoyable, rather than annoying and exhausting.

#### Thaumetal Refinery (Hard)

-   Nightmare Birchback

-   Reduced HP by 5%.

-   Nightmare Lehnym

-   Reduced HP by 5%.

Design Note: It's no secret that Thaumetal Refinery (Hard) is easier but longer than its sister dungeon, Akalath Quarantine. These slight fight time reductions will result in a faster dungeon clear without negatively affecting the final boss.

#### Draakon Arena

-   Kalligar

-   Reduced HP by 10%.

-   Increased the distance required to trigger Kalligar's range check from 8 → 13 meters.

Design Note: Draakon Arena⎯ a "mid tier" dungeon⎯ is notably difficult and long, often to an exhausting degree when compared to Gossamer Vault. This change will make the dungeon faster, especially when challenging it multiple times in a row.

#### Gossamer Vault

-   Hellgrammite

-   Reduced HP by 5%.

-   Gossamer Regent

-   Reduced HP by 5%.

Design Note: Similar to Thaumetal Refinery (Hard), Gossamer Vault is longer but easier than its sister dungeon, Draakon Arena. These changes will make the dungeon more engaging by virtue of not being as sluggish to clear.

#### RK-9 Kennel

-   Ventarun

-   The small circular back attack no longer stuns.

-   Note: The large circular back attack will still stun!

#### Thaumetal Refinery

-   Gaaruksalk

-   When a goblin is diseased, the "Urgh!" stun duration has been reduced from 5 → 3 seconds.

Class Changes
-------------

Design Note: We are aware that there are three classes that stand out and lead the pack in terms of damage. However, rather than nerfing them we instead want to try to help out the classes falling behind. Some classes have had long-outstanding quality of life they've been waiting for, while others would appreciate just a damage boost. Both of these require headroom that we currently have. Keep your eyes out for a future balance patch soon, alongside the long-awaited Berserker Tank.

#### Mystic

-   Regression

-   Fixed an issue which caused the circular area of effect indicator to not appear at the right time.

-   Added a new sound and visual effect when casting.\

Miscellaneous
-------------

#### Bug Fixes

-   Fixed an issue where following Ninja Shuriken weapon skins did not have an enchantment glow effect.

-   Ghost

-   Glass

-   Prism
