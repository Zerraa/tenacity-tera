Design Note: We've heard that festivals have been missed for the past few months, so we're releasing Harvest Festival Hall! We'll do our best to get back into the swing of seasonal festivals. Sadly not all festivals are really suited for being enjoyable to a majority of players- which is why a specific festival has yet to be released on MT. However, we'll look into it more closely and see what we can do, even if it comes later than normal.

[Event] Battle Pass ─ Season IV: Hotshot
----------------------------------------

Event Period: Ongoing  (October 22nd, 2024 ~ December 22nd, 2024)

-   Battle Pass Mission Vanguards are now available even if you reach your Vanguard request limit.

Design Note: We're aware that Vanguards are a sore spot when it comes to this Battle Pass. In truth, this was an oversight as we re-implemented the system from previous seasons which was designed with 32 Vanguards in mind. This is a hotfix to make it slightly better, but we're currently looking into options to rework Battle Pass to not be both so VG-reliant while also consuming additional VGs.

#### PvE

-   Fixed an issue with the Novice and Advanced Daily Mission Box where you could receive a random Novice/Advanced Mission Box respectively. Now you will either receive a random mission, or a Novice/Advanced Select Ticket respectively.

-   Fixed an issue where the Crystallized Heart and Unstable DNA boxes were giving the wrong item.

-   Increased the Duality Gem Box maximum purchase quantity from 10 → 30.

-   Added four new items to the BP shop:

-   Body Armor Etching: Relentless Pumped V (Untradeable)

-   Body Armor Etching: Relentless Keen V (Untradeable)

-   Footwear Etching: Relentless Pumped V (Untradeable)

-   Footwear Etching: Relentless Keen V (Untradeable)

Design Note: Some players wanted to see more endgame-relevant items added to Battle Pass, especially as we were unable to provide new cosmetics this time around. We've gone ahead and increased Duality Gem Box maximum quantity to give something more useful to endgame players, while also adding Etching V's as an expensive "exclusive" item. The shop might  expand again around halfway into BP's lifecycle. Good luck to those going for the server's first title!

[PvE] Dungeons
--------------

#### Bathysmal Rise (Normal/Hard)

-   Raised the HP of the three Hearts in the Elemental Hall minigame room.

-   Fiery Heart

-   Earthen Heart

-   Aqueous Heart

Design Note: Previously when doing the Elemental Hall minigame as intended, you would get 'stuck' due to the hearts not having enough HP. This change will allow those doing the minigame normally to do so, without affecting those who just attack the statue itself.

#### Forbidden Arena [Hagufna]

-   Fixed a few issues with loot:

-   Now drops Thaumetal Ingot instead of Feral Hide

-   Now drops Conversion Recipe: Thaumetal Ingot instead of Conversion Recipe: Feral Hide

-   Now drops [Hagufna] Pet Box rather than [Undying Warlord] Pet Box

-   Reduced Hagufna's HP by approximately 9%.

#### Forbidden Arena [Undying Warlord]

-   Reduced Undying Warlord's HP by approximately 10%.

-   Reduced the speed kill achievement to less than 4:00.

#### Forbidden Arena [Nightmare Undying Warlord]

-   Reduced Nightmare Undying Warlord's HP by approximately 4%.

-   Reduced the speed kill achievement to less than 6:00.

#### Ruinous Manor (Hard)

-   Reduced Nightmare Resurrected Atrocitas' HP by approximately 11%.

-   Reduced Nightmare Resurrected Malgarios' HP by approximately 11%.

-   Reduced Nightmare Lachelith's HP by approximately 17%.

#### Sky Cruiser Endeavor (Normal)

-   Reduced Perimos' HP by approximately 16%.

#### The Plexus (Hard)

-   Reduced Nightmare Shandra Manaya's HP by approximately 7%.

[PvP] Civil Unrest
------------------

-   Fixed the following issues with Argentus:

-   Now displays map marker in Civil Unrest

-   Now correctly sends loot upon death

-   HP bar now displays correctly
