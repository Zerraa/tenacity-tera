[PvE] Dungeons
--------------

#### Corrupted RK-9 Kennel

-   Reduced HP from 16 billion (+1.6b healing) → 15.4 billion (+ 1.54b healing)

#### Frozen Bahaar's Sanctum

-   Increased HP from 21.0 billion → 21.8 billion

Class Changes
-------------

####  Gunner

-   [PvE] Reduced overall DMG by 3%.

####  Mystic

-   Arun's Tears,  Arun's Vitae

-   Fixed an issue where, when using the Glyph of Blaze on both motes, the third mote cast would not receive the attack speed bonus.

Design Note: Due to the attack speed not applying due to this bug, it also caused the third mote to fail to cast ("ghost") when using Skill Prediction. Now that this bug has been fixed, Blazing motes are now a more viable option.

####  Ninja

-   Attunement

-   Lightning Spirit Advancement

-   Fixed an issue which prevented Chi from being gained immediately when used to cancel a skill.

Design Note: Lightning Spirit Attunement has always granted Chi immediately when cast while running or stationary. However, when casting it to cancel another one of Ninja's skills, it would previously not grant the Chi immediately.
