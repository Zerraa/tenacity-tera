# Gear Adjustments

## [PvE] Veilbound Gear
- RNG has been removed, with all enchantment tiers having a 100% success rate.
- The material cost per enchant has gone up as a result of this change.
- The average grind from +0 to +15 has been reduced by a bit over 13%.

*Design Note*: We sought to hear the community’s perspective on what gearing system they preferred, and over 850 of you responded overwhelmingly. When the poll ended, 70% of you advocated for the removal of RNG and we have delivered. This change has also been paired with a sizable reduction in the average progression grind. This, paired with other changes made in this patch will make the gearing path less demoralizing and monotonous─ especially for those plagued by “unfavorable” RNG.

## [PvE] Elemental Accessories

### Crystallized Earrings
- You can upgrade your Agaia Earrings into Crystallized Earrings by using Crystallized Cores found in the Gossamer Vault (Hard).

### Aether Circlet
- You can upgrade your Agaia Circlet into an Aether Circlet by using Aether Cores found in the Rift's Edge (Normal).

### Renamed Items:
- Frozen Agaia Ring → Frozen Ring
- Scorching Agaia Necklace → Scorching Necklace
- Inferno Core → Scorching Core
- Earth Circlet Resizing Stone → Wind Circlet Resizing Stone
- Earth Circlet Resizing Token → Wind Circlet Resizing Token
- Wind Earring Resizing Stone → Earth Earring Resizing Stone
- Wind Earring Resizing Token → Earth Earring Resizing Token

## [PvP] Disciplinary, Impregnable, Harmonic and Furious Gear
- Reduced the attack speed line on weapons from 18% → 8% for all classes.
- This change was already applied to the Champion’s Skyring weapons as of Patch 1.8.2.

*Design Note*: Back in Patch 1.8.2, we implemented a similar change specifically within the Champion’s Skyring. In those patch notes, we outlined our long-term plan to standardize the attack speed reduction across all PvP content. The time has come to enact this change. The reason behind this reduction lies in a patch over a year ago where we globally increased the attack speed for all types of play. Unfortunately, this unintentionally led to certain undesirable side effects in PvP, including enabling otherwise impossible skill combos, lowering the difficulty of certain combos and follow-up executions, and shortening the time-to-kill. With this adjustment, we’ve rectified these unintended foundational changes which address some of the broad issues found on our server before we tackle class-specific problems─ which we will do in due time.

We want non-Avenging Talons guardians to be engaging and fun to do while in queue, with Avenging Talons being the standout “difficult” one.

- **[PvP] Fixed an issue** where Mystics and Priests could heal more than intended when using a Valkyon Health Potion.

*Design Note*: We understand that small-scale PvP fights, especially duels, would often devolve into a frustrating endless fight. These changes will bring small-scale PvP to a healthier state and make fights more enjoyable.

## Miscellaneous Changes
- Reduced the maximum size of a raid from 30 → 20 players.
- Reduced the maximum channel count of various zones down to 1. This mostly affects zones with Guardian Legion missions.

## Class Changes
*Design Note*: Embrace the Veil with the long-awaited Berserker Tank! In its current state, we expect Berserker Tank to thrive and likely over-perform with the new tools for its environment. However, we would like to invite our community to try out the changes as-is. Try the class out, play a new playstyle, theorycraft what could possibly work, and most importantly please give us your feedback and let us know your opinions! We will be keeping an eye on the class’ overall performance, as well as any feedback you give to make further adjustments as necessary.

### Berserker

  - This change and the one above will result in an equalization of the skill’s cooldown and will make it similar to the “steroid” skills from other classes (such as In Cold Blood, Windsong, etc.) - This is a very small nerf to Berserker in open world PvP and a huge buff in battlegrounds.
- **Mock Advancement** has been completely reworked:
  - Replaced the old icon with a new one () to match the reworked advancement.
  - When Bloodlust is cast, applies Flurry of Blows II and Raging Fury to all party members within 40 meters.

  - [PvP] When the Unleashed effect ends, applies a two-minute cooldown to Unleashed: Beast Fury.
- **Unleashed: Beast Fury**
  - When used during Intimidation:
    - You cannot disable Intimidation for two minutes.
    - The cooldown is increased to 2:25 and a cooldown is applied to Unleash.

### Brawler
- **Rhythmic Blows**: When casting the skill with Growing Fury’s Irregular Advancement, applies a debuff that prevents you from casting Rhythmic Blows for 55 seconds.

*Design Note*: This change was made to prevent Brawler DPS from using Rhythmic Blows every ~40 seconds when other classes are limited to ~60-second pops.

  - Increased projectile speed.

*Design Note*: We understand that these changes may not align with what the Gunner community was hoping for this update. We’ve been closely following the Gunner feedback posts and understand your requests. Rest assured, we also want to provide many of the changes listed! Sadly, many of the major changes that were asked for aren’t straightforward and take time to implement─ especially if we don’t want to introduce more bugs─ while also investing adequate time into other parts of the patch. Instead of following our past motif of waiting until we have the time, we decided to release smaller interim adjustments until we can address the larger concerns with the classes.

### Lancer
- **Adrenaline Rush**
  - [PvP: Battlegrounds] Reverted a change made in Patch 1.7 where the cooldown was increased by 50%. This change affects all battlegrounds.
- **Chained Leash**
  - Reduced range from 15 → 6 meters.
  - The range of the “chained pull” remains the same.
  - [PvP: Champion’s Skyring] This change is not applied.

- **Summon: Group**: Reduced cooldown from 30 → 22 minutes.

### Ninja
- [PvE] Increased overall Skill DMG by 2%.
- **Double Cut**
  - Force Enhancement: During Inner Harmony, this EP effect has a 100% chance to activate.

### Priest
- **Focus Heal**
  - Heal Advancement: Fixed an issue which caused the skill to not be affected by its Noctenium Infusion effect.
- **Summon: Group**: Reduced cooldown from 30 → 22 minutes.

### Sorcerer
- [PvE] Reduced overall Skill DMG by 2%.
- **Arcane Pulse**: Increased innate CRIT Rate by approximately 33%.
- **Implosion, Iceberg**
  - [PvP] Opponents hit will be unable to use dodge and movement abilities while knocked up.
  - Opponents hit will be forced to use Retaliate or wait to land back to the ground to get out of the knockup.
- **Meteor Strike**
  - **Meteor Shower**
    - [PvE] Increased base DMG from 13259 → 16060.
    - Meteor Shower is the enhanced variant of Meteor Strike granted during Mana Boost.

### Slayer
- [PvE] Increased overall Skill DMG by 1.3%.
- **In Cold Blood**
  - [PvE] Increased the duration from 25 → 29 seconds.
- **Savage Strike**: Fixed a bug which caused the first cast to provide a lower charging speed buff than the second cast.
- **Unsheathe**: Upon successful hit at maximum charge, applies the Overcharged effect for 10 seconds, increasing your Skill DMG to monsters by 10%.

### Valkyrie
- **Evasion**: You can now cancel the skill with most other skills 250 milliseconds before it would normally end.
- **Godsfall**
  - On a successful hit of the second cast, generates 7 Runemarks.
  - On second cast, resets the cooldown of Gungnir’s Bite and Shining Crescent.
- **Ragnarok**: Resets the cooldown of Gungnir’s Bite.
- **Runeburst**
  - Increased skill attack speed by 40%.
  - [PvE] Increased Skill DMG by 60%.
- **Titansbane**
  - **Sheen Advancement**: While affected by Bloody Eclipse the damage boost provided to Runeburst has been reduced from 50% → 20%.
- **Twilight Waltz**
  - [PvE] During the fourth cast, you are immune to most crowd control effects.

### Warrior
- **Blade Draw**
  - Glyph of Persistence: Increased reset chance from 60% → 70%.
- **Blade Frenzy**
  - [PvE] On successful hit, generates 10 Edge.
- **Deadly Gamble**
  - [PvE] When cast, applies Glyph of the Swift and resets the cooldown of Blade Waltz.
  - This requires Deadly Gamble’s Bellicosity or Spirit of Iron advancements to apply.
- **Death from Above, Evasive Roll**
  - [PvE] When cast, if Glyph of the Swift does not activate; it applies a “pity” buff. When this “pity” buff reaches 3 stacks, it activates Glyph of the Swift.
  - The “pity” buff cannot coexist with activations of Glyph of the Swift. All stacks are consumed when it activates, and stacks cannot be obtained while it is active.
  - This effect will apply even if you do not equip the Glyph of the Swift to either skill. Additionally, this effect requires either Assault Stance or Defensive Stance and their corresponding Deadly Gamble Skill Advancement (Bellicosity or Spirit of Iron).
- **One with the Sword**: Effect now persists through death.
- **Rain of Blows**
  - **Dueling Scar Advancement**: While Defensive Stance is active, increases Rain of Blows innate CRIT Rate by 100%.

- **Shadow of the Tempest II (Effect)**: Increased duration from 15 → 16.2 seconds.
- **Traverse Cut**
  - **Furious Traverse Cut**: Effect now persists through death.

*Design Note*: Initially, our goal was to make stacking Defensive Stance Warrior’s Traverse Cut’s party buff easier. We experimented with various approaches, but unfortunately, all of them had negative effects on PvP. Given that PvP is moving away from the dominant “attack speed meta” we established by increasing the base attack speed of all classes by 10%, we’ve decided to not make further changes at this time. However, we will continue investigating potential solutions to making Traverse Cut easier to stack and less punishing when a player in your party dies.

## [PvP] Battleground Changes

### Fraywind Canyon
- Changed queue type from premade to solo queue.
- Increased overall Skill DMG while in the battleground by 10%.
- **Potent Teralith**
  - Increased spawn time from 2:33 → 3:00.
  - Reduced respawn time from 5:00 → 4:00.
  - Reduced the duration of the Powerful Morale buff from 3:00 → 2:30.
    - This is the buff that gets applied to the team that lands the killing blow against the Potent Teralith.
- **Naga Reaver**
  - Increased spawn time from 3:53 → 4:20.
  - Reduced respawn time from 5:00 → 4:00.
  - Removed fall DMG.
- The Cooldown Reduction effect provided to the party from Adrenaline Rush and One With the Sword has been disabled.

*Design Note*: We’ve noticed that players tend to prefer faster battlegrounds, rather than games that require a high time investment. Fraywind Canyon was riddled with stalled fights far too often, slowing down the overall battleground progression. The changes made will alleviate this, and we’ll keep a close eye on how Fraywind Canyon games go after this change and make further adjustments if necessary.

### Shore Hold
- The Cooldown Reduction effect provided to the party from Adrenaline Rush and One With the Sword has been disabled.

### Miscellaneous
- Battlefield Awareness now blocks Gunner’s Replenishment.
- Added an informative guide buff to Champion’s Skyring, Fraywind Canyon, and Shore Hold that explains the unique rules of their respective battleground.

## [PvP] Civil Unrest
- Changed the map to Velika.
- Moved the opening and starting time to occur 1 hour earlier.
- Reduced maximum Civil Unrest participants per guild from 30 players → 20 players.
- All BAMs now spawn at one of the two locations:
  - “North Grass”

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcALPf745IB47GeLJm9rXKn_jz4rJXIMQu550P35IyXysUNxOJXVDIp11sZZw0kskMiXfR7pJ6Lb9INnR987QbYAxz0SzIc3GGb55DD3eXeHbMwQD6oq41Oku2e9vIw3FMvhJytFrpZRnZs2SiI3Hlb00pw?key=_fnk0VtJmMNmB6fxw17QLw)

  - “South Grass”

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdX8IxUFHiME_OZn1OfC212zOoA5fCbhi0eeBTvzY_CFTGF4rtK2r6jPOQfyM2iIZkAK4hIrMC1gRfuf08XQmFHxbdk8Ydv_fnrwAUTE9-Zld2ucSwMUNAtLNemPJksjzjZuTyvxh5ot-xYJpCGx-ZNNG__?key=_fnk0VtJmMNmB6fxw17QLw)

- The buffs provided by Lavathus, Drakhan, and Kaithan will now overwrite each other.
  - This change affects “Lavathus’s Shell”, “Drakhan’s Flame”, and “Kaithan’s Fear”.
- Reduced the respawn time after being killed from 20 seconds → 15 seconds.
- You cannot place a Guild Tower around the Velika Travel Control Office and adjacent areas.
- Set the Civil Unrest mount to the Free Trader’s Fortuna.
- Set the Civil Unrest outfit to the Free Trader’s Tabard.

### Rally: Argentus (Sunday)
- Due to Civil Unrest opening an hour earlier, the spawn time has also been moved back 1 hour.

*Design Note*: Our goal is to make Civil Unrest more fun for all players. We’ve been considering lowering the participation cap for some time, and now we’ve found the right opportunity to do so. In the past, we adjusted this cap to align with our community, but this change is more crucial than ever. With the reduced participation cap, we’ve also switched to a smaller map, which should create a more dynamic experience. Furthermore, this reduction in maximum participants will improve the playability of classes that faced a disadvantage in 30 vs 30 PvP, such as the Berserker, Slayer, and Valkyrie.

### Miscellaneous
- Updated the DMG / heal number font size’s minimum from 100 → 25.
- [PvP] Fixed an issue which caused players to be able to dodge out of a knock-up chain if an HP potion is used or they are cleansed.
- Slightly increased the size of Partner: White Puppy.
