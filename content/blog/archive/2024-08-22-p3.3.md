-   [Item Level 527] Frozen Bahaar's Sanctum

-   [Item Level 527] Forbidden Arena [Hagufna]

Design Note: While we aren't always able to reintroduce the dungeons requested for one reason or another, in this case we have added the Bahaar's Sanctum and Forbidden Arena per overwhelming community feedback. We understand that players would like to see a lot of our existing lineup rotate, and we will look into the feasibility of this during the 3.3 patch cycle.

#### [PvE] Closed Dungeons

-   The following dungeons are closing their doors:

-   Draakon Arena (Hard)

-   Sanctuary's Ruins (Hard)

Design Note: We understand that players are getting bored of our current lineup, and these dungeons have been here since the start of 3.0. Sanctuary's Ruins predates even that, which doesn't help matters any. As previously stated, we know that players want to see us rotate our existing content, and we'll be looking to do that during this patch cycle.

#### [PvE] Loot Adjustments

Design Note: We have increased loot across the board for Veilbound gearing, including the Aether, Crystallized, Frozen and Inferno Cores. This will make it easier to gear new classes or characters, and for returning players to get back into the swing of endgame content if their current gear has since been sunset.

-   Frozen Bahaar's Sanctum

-   Inherited the drop table from Sanctuary's Ruins (Hard).

-   Increased Void Vial drops from the entire dungeon from 6 → 9.

-   Forbidden Arena [Hagufna]

-   Inherited the drop table from Draakon Arena (Hard).

-   Increased Sentient Energy drops from the entire dungeon from 6 → 9.

[PvE] Class Changes
-------------------

Looking for PvP Class Changes? Click [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ytR6pBt5wSYYqS_idDS93RPrDWJjE9W9Mx4u0RjGLuw/edit#heading=h.ub42rj3nyx7a). We've decided to split PvE and PvP Class Changes, rather than making one large combined list. This change was made to help improve patch note readability and make it easier to tell what is affecting your gameplay. We'll continue trying out slightly different formats to see what works best.

####  [PvE]  Mystic

Design Note: Mystic has not been the average PvE healer's first choice for quite some time. While it's true that Mystic and Priest do similar damage and provide similar damage boosts to their team, Mystic simply does not provide the same utility as Priest. Differences aside, at the end of the day this causes Mystic to underperform both socially and mechanically. In our previous attempts to alleviate this, the Mystic community was split on what direction Mystic should be taken. This rework hopes to offer various play style options for the community to experiment with. Please try it out and let us know what you think!

-   Disabled the Wrath of Spirits Enhancement.

-   A new Enhanced Totem system has been implemented. Depending on the Boomerang Pulse Skill Advancement selected, the Warding Totem skill performs differently! See the Boomerang Pulse section for more information.

-   Note: This only applies if you are using a Bloodshard or Veilbound PvE weapon.

-   Boomerang Pulse

-   The three Skill Advancements have been completely reworked, applying a variety of changes to the Mystic class. All three below will be listed, including their changes to Mystic's function.

-   Chain Advancement

-   Arunic Release

-   Reduced cooldown by 20%.

-   Increased PvE DMG by 25%.

-   Metamorphic Blast

-   Reduced PvE DMG by 75%.

-   Metamorphic Smite

-   Reduced PvE DMG by 75%.

-   Enhanced Totem

-   Warding Totem grants immunity to knockdown and staggers and provides a shield that absorbs up to 30,000 HP to all allies for 6 seconds. However, it increases incoming PvP DMG by 50% while the shield is active.

-   Preserve Advancement (formerly known as the Amplification Advancement)

-   Arunic Release

-   Increased cooldown by 20%.

-   Increased PvE DMG by 25%.

-   Increased healing by 15%.

-   Reduced MP Cost from 520 → 200.

-   Increased cooldown by 25%.

-   No longer has the ability to hit players.

-   Thrall of Life

-   Increases healing of the initial AoE by 20%.

-   Enhanced Totem

-   Warding Totem reduces incoming PvE DMG by 7% to allies within the totem's effect radius.

-   Metamorphic Blast

-   Propulsion Enhancement

-   Changed the Skill Advancement effect as follows:

-   OLD: On successful hit, has a 25% chance to reset Metamorphic Smite.

-   NEW: On successful hit, reduce the cooldown of Metamorphic Smite by 2 seconds and increase Metamorphic Smite's DMG by 20% for a short period.

-   Metamorphic Smite

-   Propulsion Enhancement

-   Changed the Skill Advancement effect as follows:

-   OLD: On successful hit, has a 25% chance to reset Metamorphic Blast and increase DMG by 20%.

-   NEW: On successful hit of a monster, reduce the cooldown of Metamorphic Blast by 2 seconds and increase Metamorphic Blast's DMG by 40% for a short period.

General Content
---------------

-   All reset timers have been unified to 7 AM UTC.

-   Note: This is the reset time that is visible when you open the Vanguard Request window. 

#### Astrum Coin

-   You can no longer use the old Liberation Scroll, as it has been replaced by the Nexus Liberation Scroll. To liberate Veilbound gear, including the "Elemental" accessory line, you'll need to purchase a new Nexus Liberation Scroll.

#### Ace Dungeons

-   [Ace] Sky Cruiser Endeavor

-   Increased the amount of Infused Scrap from 3 → 6.

-   Added 4 Veil Dust to the loot table.

-   [Ace] Ruinous Manor

-   Increased the amount of Thaumetal Slag from 3 → 6.

-   Added 4 Veil Dust to the loot table.

#### Guardian Legion

-   Guardian Legion Reputation Shop

-   Reduced price of Veil Dust from 720 → 450 Guardian Legion Credits.

-   Reduced price of Monster Soul from 480 → 450 Guardian Legion Credits.

-   Avenging Talons

-   Increased cooldown from 2 → 3 hours.

-   Reduced Magnuut's ATK by 15%.

-   Reduced Est's ATK by 20%.

-   Reduced Ost's ATK by 20%.

-   Magnuut's Silver Chest contents changed to the following:

-   6x Unstable DNA

-   6x Crystallized Heart

-   Magnuut's Gold Chest contents changed to the following:

-   12x Unstable DNA

-   12x Crystallized Heart 

-   Escape from Balder's Refuge

-   Increased Vehemos' Silver Chest's Crystallized Heart from 3 → 6.

-   Increased Vehemos' Gold Chest's Crystallized Heart from 6 → 12.

-   Shadow of the Gutrends

-   Increased Dreadreaper's Silver Chest's Unstable DNA from 3 → 6.

-   Increased Dreadreaper's Gold Chest's Unstable DNA from 6 → 12.

Design Note: Sadly, Dreadreaper and Vehemos have fallen to the wayside when it comes to viable options to acquire materials. To partially alleviate this, the rewards have been increased to be more respectful to the time investment. When it comes to Magnuut, he was originally giving the same high-tier materials as Perdidrax; which left a metaphoric "hole" for mid tier gearing material acquisition methods. Due to this, we have swapped Magnuut's materials to the mid tier ones.

#### New World Bosses

Design Note: The three Argon World Bosses were primarily an experiment on using more diverse content for us; and we feel that it went very well! However, all good things also have bad parts that make up the whole. We feel that leaving World Bosses as they are will harm the game more than it'll help, and some players would agree. So, this patch will shift their usefulness around a bit. We don't want to "kill" world bosses, but we need to find a line where they don't negatively impact the main draw of TERA's PvE: Dungeons.

-   Argon Predator's Chest

-   Increased Veil Dust from 12 → 18.

Design Note: This world boss exists mostly as a jumpstart for low-tier materials, which means some players may choose to ignore him entirely. The dust amount has increased as the dust quantity from RK-9 Kennel (Normal) and Thaumetal Refinery (Normal) have also gone up.

-   Suulvir Mastermind's Chest

-   Increased Veil Dust from 22 → 30.

-   Reduced Unstable DNA from 12 → 6.

-   Reduced Crystallized Heart from 12 → 6.

Design Note: Originally this world boss was arguably more difficult than Perdidrax yet still dropped mid tier materials, resulting in players oftentimes ignoring it entirely. To give Suulvir a niche, we've reduced the amount of Crystallized Heart and Unstable DNA while increasing the amount of dust. No matter what tier you're in, dust is always nice to have, so this should make Suulvir Mastermind a more appealing option.

-   Perdidrax's Chest

-   Reduced Feral Hide from 18 → 12.

-   Reduced Thaumetal Ingot from 18 → 12.

Design Note: After the buff, this world boss is quite difficult but also very rewarding, and is often the biggest pointer for "too overpowered and hurts dungeons", out of the three. We agree, and as such this world boss is receiving a raw nerf to the materials it drops. These high-tier materials are still harder to get and should remain an eye catching option to kill even though the rates are reduced... Without negatively impacting Akalath Quarantine and Thaumetal Refinery (Hard) as much.

#### Old World Bosses

-   We have reduced a large portion of World Bosses respawn times. All bosses listed have had their respawn times reduced, some of them have had major problems fixed, and more. We cannot share the exact respawn times with you, but instead we will share the four "groups" that these monsters find themselves in. The earlier groups have a lower respawn time, while the later ones have a higher respawn time.

-   Nyxarras [Lv.68]

-   Betsael [Lv.68]

-   Yunaras Snaggletooth [Lv.68]

-   Linyphi [Lv.68]

-   Monsters that find themselves within "Group 4" have also received an adjustment to their loot on death. These monsters can now drop the following loot:

-   Ruby

-   Sapphire

-   Emerald

-   Diamond

-   Veil Dust

-   Thaumetal Slag

-   Infused Scrap

-   Raised the height of Raiga's nameplate to fix an issue where their nameplate was not visible.

#### Achievements

-   Achievements have been updated for all changes made in this patch, with new additions and removals.

-   Removed the following monsters erroneously required for the achievement "Rule Southern Shara" due to them not being a "named world boss" as the achievement states:

-   Gluttonous Fangspawn 

-   Trihorn Dracoloth 

-   Vulcan Wastewalker 

-   Bloodtalon Dracoloth 

-   Vale Hunter Arachnen 

-   Magmar Teralith 

-   Sandlurker Lizard

-   Fixed an issue where Gossamer Vault (Hard) was incorrectly written as Gossamer Vault (Easy).

-   Corrected the item level required and written for the following quests from Item Level 524 → 527:

-   Dawn of the Butterflies

-   Gossamer Vault (Hard)

[PvP] Kalash Equipment
----------------------

#### [PvP] Limited Akalath and Kalash Relic / Halidom

-   Akalath and Kalash Relic and Halidom are available through the Corsair's Stronghold event. You can view more information on this event by clicking [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ytR6pBt5wSYYqS_idDS93RPrDWJjE9W9Mx4u0RjGLuw/edit#heading=h.159nz5ob2uq2).

-   The Akalath and Kalash Relic and Halidom have random rolls that can be rerolled using a Kalash Option Change Scroll.

-   Tanzanite is used to lock desired rolls.

-   You can obtain Kalash Option Change Scrolls and Tanzanite through Kalash Option Change Boxes, which will be available through the following sources:

-   Corsair's Stronghold Event's [Golden Cannon Shop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ytR6pBt5wSYYqS_idDS93RPrDWJjE9W9Mx4u0RjGLuw/edit#heading=h.159nz5ob2uq2)

-   [Melkatran](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ytR6pBt5wSYYqS_idDS93RPrDWJjE9W9Mx4u0RjGLuw/edit#heading=h.crox8ase3d93)

#### [PvP] Kalash Shards

-   Added two new Kalash Weapon Shards which can be obtained from the Kalash Shard Box (Weapon)

|


Glistening Kalash Weapon Shard

Increases DMG against knocked-up opponents.

 |

Pounding Kalash Weapon Shard

Increases CRIT Power against knocked-up opponents.

 |

Design Note: Firstly, we'd like to thank the community for their feedback regarding the Kalash Shards we introduced. From your feedback, we have added some much-requested knock-up based shards. For those who feel they can capitalize on knock-up-based shards, please feel free to try them out and let us know what you think!

[PvP] Civil Unrest
------------------

-   Increased the amount of Riftbound Tribute Credits (250) awarded to the Rank 3 guild from 3 → 4.

Design Note: This is a small adjustment but we feel it was necessary to encourage participation. It should make Civil Unrest feel a bit better to compete in if you aren't able to score Rank 1 or 2.

[PvP] Echoes of Argonea
-----------------------

#### [PvP] Melkatran

-   Melkatran, a ruthless Invisible Argon BAM, has been detected patrolling through the Echoes of Argonea.

-   To see Melkatran, you'll need to use the Argon Detection Totem.

-   Upon death, Melkatran will drop Melkatran's Treasure Chest for the killing party, which contains the following:

-   Argon Dust

-   Kalash Option Change Box

-   Kalash Shard Box (Armor)

-   Kalash Shard Box (Weapon)

-   Tanzanite

#### [PvP] World Boss: Chrono Keeper

-   Reduced the amount of Riftbound Tribute Credits (250) obtained from last hit from 10 → 7.

-   Made some changes to how Chrono Keeper works to improve the fight and keep the last hit competition fair.

Design Note: We understand that some players are unhappy with the last hit mechanics of World Bosses, notably Chrono Keeper. This is often caused by feeling like your class is incapable of obtaining the last hit, and that others may have an unfair advantage by other means. Instead of removing the last hit reward outright, we want to try to make adjustments to make the system more fair for everyone. We'll keep an eye on how this performs and make adjustments if necessary.

#### [PvP] Echoes Overview

-   Added an additional Cleric to Kanstria.

#### [PvP] Echoes Daily Quests

-   Reduced the amount of credits awarded for the "Obtain Argon Extractor Keys" quest from 125 → 65.

[PvP] Rally Changes
-------------------

#### Tuesday: Draelteryx

-   Increased the amount of Riftbound Tribute Credits (250) awarded to the Rank 2 party from 2 → 4.

-   Increased the amount of Riftbound Tribute Credits (250) awarded to the Rank 3 party from 1 → 3.

#### Friday: Maskimxuul

-   Increased the amount of Riftbound Tribute Credits (250) awarded to the Rank 2 party from 2 → 4.

-   Increased the amount of Riftbound Tribute Credits (250) awarded to the Rank 3 party from 1 → 3.

Design Note: We understand that many players feel that Rally does not respect their time, heavily favoring the Rank 1 party and disincentivizing even participating unless you can get Rank 1. We also noticed that PvPing was discouraged due to needing to PvE the Rally BAM for Rank 1- and by extension for any meaningful rewards. We hope that these changes make Rally more encouraging to do, while also making PvP a more viable option without feeling like you're getting nearly nothing for the effort.

[PvP]  Class Changes
--------------------

Looking for PvE Class Changes? Click [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ytR6pBt5wSYYqS_idDS93RPrDWJjE9W9Mx4u0RjGLuw/edit#heading=h.pwomiftqjp43). We've decided to split PvE and PvP Class Changes, rather than making one large combined list. This change was made to help improve patch note readability and make it easier to tell what is affecting your gameplay. We'll continue trying out slightly different formats to see what works best.

#### [PvP]  All Classes

-   All "Crit Power Passives" from mounts are now disabled in Battlegrounds and Civil Unrest.

Design Note: Crit Power Passives provided by mounts are a very strong tool to increase damage in PvE, but there are multiple issues with it for PvP. Some classes have a higher impact from Crit Power than others, making them able to utilize a Crit Power Passive more effectively. To even up the playing field between classes, we have decided to just disable these passives in some content. We're keeping an eye on how these passives affect Open World PvP and will make further adjustments as necessary.

####  [PvP]  Archer

-   Stunning Trap

-   Increased the stun duration by 33% while inside Champion's Skyring.

Design Note: While we stand behind the reduction of Stunning Trap's stun duration, it was a bit too powerful in Champion's Skyring. This change will give back Archer some combo power without completely reverting the stun duration back to its original state.

####  [PvP]  Gunner

-   Balder's Vengeance

-   Reduced PvE DMG by 50% in all Battlegrounds.

-   Obliteration

-   Reduced the duration of the provided buff from 7 → 2 seconds.

Design Note: Gunner's ultimate ability is extremely powerful, and causes Gunner to be able to comfortably take BAM last hits far too easily. This adjustment will bring Balder's Vengeance's PvE performance closer to other class ultimate abilities. When it comes to Obliteration, the buff provided is quite powerful when paired with the raise of CRIT Power and DMG from behind, so the duration of the buff has been reduced.

####  [PvP]  Lancer

-   Chained Leash

-   The stun effect applied from the skill is now cleared upon Knockdown.

-   Increased the range from 6 → 9 meters.

-   Guardian Shout

-   While Adrenaline Rush's March Advancement is selected, Guardian Shout cannot be used.

-   Guardian Shout no longer stacks with Adrenaline Rush's March Advancement.

-   You can still obtain the Guardian Power buff from other Lancers.

-   Shield Bash

-   Disabled the Reload Enhancement while in the Champion's Skyring.

Design Note: The goal for Lancer's March Advancement is to offer Lancer players a more diverse and offensive play style while losing their normal utility. While this did happen due to losing party-wide Adrenaline Rush, Lancer was still providing far too much utility with March selected, which is against what our objective for the advancement is. Shield Bash proves to be extremely powerful in the Champion's Skyring due to its combo potential when the Reload Enhancement activates. We will continue to keep a close look on Lancer and make further adjustments if necessary.

####  [PvP]  Mystic

-   Disabled the Wrath of Spirits Enhancement.

-   Arun's Vitae

-   Reduced the Healing over Time effect provided by two stacks of Arun's Vitae from 35,000 → 24,000.

-   Boomerang Pulse

-   Reverted a change made in a previous patch which reduced healing by 10% in Corsair's Stronghold, Fraywind Canyon, Gridiron and Shore Hold.

-   Note: This reduction has not been reverted in the Champion's Skyring.

-   Resurrection

-   Casting this skill will remove Rallying Cry if applicable.

-   While casting, you can no longer gain the following anti-knockdown/anti-stagger effects:

-   Holy Burst

-   Kaia's Shield

-   Rallying Cry

-   Sky Lotus

-   Thrall of Protection

-   Thrall of Life

-   Reverted a change made in a previous patch which reduced initial AoE healing by 10% in all Battlegrounds.

-   Note: This does not affect the Thrall of Life's persistent healing effect, only the initial healing upon cast applied while under the effects of Thrall Augmentation.

-   Thrall of Vengeance

-   The increased Crit Power provided by the Thrall now applies against players.

-   Thrall of Wrath

-   When summoned, increases PvP DMG by 7%.

-   Titanic Favor

-   Increased healing by 10% in all Battlegrounds.

Design Note: Mystic was- at one point- overpowered and nerfed repeatedly because of it. This, paired with some PvE changes affecting PvP, have caused Mystic to be not much more than a Regression and CDR class. These changes aim to slightly shift Mystic's already strong self healing into more sustainable team healing, while improving their buffs and making them more on par with Priest. When it comes to Resurrection, check the [PvP] Priest Design Notes for more information.

####  [PvP]  Ninja

-   Decoy Jutsu

-   After hitting a target, it now reduces their Movement Speed by 80% for 1.5 seconds.

Design Note: One of Ninja's major drawbacks is their lack of initiation tools, especially for small-scale PvP scenarios. This change will give them an option to take fights more often.

####  [PvP]  Priest

-   Resurrection

-   Casting this skill will remove Rallying Cry if applicable.

-   While casting, you can no longer gain the following anti-knockdown/anti-stagger effects:

-   Holy Burst

-   Kaia's Shield

-   Rallying Cry

-   Sky Lotus

-   Thrall of Protection

Design Note: For the past few patches, we have been trying to improve the resurrection meta's potency. Now that open world PvP has been coming back into the limelight, we're seeing that this wasn't properly corrected. This change will make casting Resurrection less "free" by making healers more vulnerable, causing Resurrection to be more punishing.

####  [PvP]  Slayer

-   Reverted a change made in a previous patch which reduced overall DMG by 15% in the Champion's Skyring.

-   Exhausting Blow

-   Increased effect duration from 4 → 7 seconds.

-   In Cold Blood

-   Reduced DMG by 10% during the effect in the Champion's Skyring.

Design Note: Slayer has been underperforming in the Champion's Skyring and overall in duel situations. Slayer has been nerfed multiple times, but after other classes were adjusted we feel that Slayer's nerfs added up to an oppressive amount. The adjustments made here will give Slayer back their lost damage outside of burn, while also slightly boosting their damage during burn. We've also returned some power to their Exhausting Blow, which we feel was over-nerfed.

####  [PvP]  Sorcerer

-   Reverted a previous change which increased Sorcerer's overall DMG by 10% in the Champion's Skyring.

-   Mana Boost

-   Increased DMG by 10% during the effect in the Champion's Skyring.

Design Note: As it turns out, Sorcerer was overperforming with the previous changes, on top of other class's prowesses being reduced. Shifting their out of burn damage boost to their burn will make them less overwhelming while not affecting their damage during burn.

[PvP]  Miscellaneous
--------------------

-   Removed a 4% PvP DMG reduction found on the following etchings:

-   Weapon Etching: Keen IV

-   Handwear Etching: Keen IV

-   Added a tooltip to correctly state that the following etchings have a 4% PvP DMG reduction:

-   Weapon Etching: Pumped IV

-   Handwear Etching: Pumped IV

-   Body Armor Etching: Pumped IV

-   Body Armor Etching: Keen IV

-   Footwear Etching: Pumped IV

-   Footwear Etching: Keen IV

Design Note: In a previous patch nearly a year and a half ago, we added a PvP DMG reduction to Keen and Pumped IV etchings, but no tooltip was added regarding this adjustment. Over time, this change was unfortunately forgotten due to this improper documentation, causing us to recently become aware of this change again. We have decided to allow the usage of Keen IV on Weapon and Handwear due to the PvP meta shifting into more CRIT Power focus. However, we don't have any intentions to reintroduce glass cannon builds by using fully offensive etchings, and we won't allow Pumped IV etchings due to the amount of Power oversaturation that exists right now.

-   Changed the [PvP] Flame Aura effect as follows:

-   OLD: Increases PvP Attack by 5%.

-   NEW: Increases PvP Attack by 10.

-   Changed the [PvP] Frost Aura effect as follows:

-   OLD: Increases PvP Defense by 5%.

-   NEW: Increases PvP Defense by 10.

-   Changed the [PvP] Akalath Essence as follows:

-   NEW: Increases PvP Attack by 12 and PvP Defense by 8.
