Design Note: It's time to say goodbye to these dungeons which have either been here for quite some time, or have been met with a majority negative player reception.

#### Dungeon Lineup

With this update to the lineup, we are removing Item Level 518 from the dungeon roster. We feel this change will streamline the gearing experience and smooth out the difficulty curve for new and returning players. Below is a list of each tier and their accompanying dungeons:

[PvE] Gearing Adjustments
-------------------------

#### Elemental Belt, Brooch and Mask

-   Increased the drop quantities of Duality Gems in Item Level 527 dungeons.

Design Note: Overall, we're very happy with the last patch and how it performed, including the new BBM and Corrupted RK-9 Kennel (CRK). One major kink we'd like to work out is the disparity in drop quantities between CRK and the rest of the lineup. We still want CRK to feel rewarding, especially considering it's the hardest dungeon to date; but that doesn't mean the drop quantities in lower tiers can't be a bit better. In general, we want all tiers of late game play to feel rewarding without stepping on CRK's toes too much.

#### Veilbound Gear

-   Adjusted loot across the entire lineup, making gearing noticeably faster, especially early game.

Design Note: A recurring theme in our recent feedback survey was that players don't enjoy being forced to do low tier dungeons ad nauseam. This is primarily something we'll need to keep in mind moving forward, but with Veilbound this can be helped by reducing the early game (<=Item Level 524) grind. The goal is to keep the new late game grind (i.e; the new Belt, Brooch and Mask) roughly the same while allowing players to access it sooner.

#### Elemental Accessories

-   Moved Inferno Core, Frozen Core and Aether Core to be dropped from Item Level 524 to streamline the gearing experience while simultaneously increasing their drop quantities slightly.

Design Note: As Veilbound gearing has gotten faster since 3.0, new and returning players quickly become overwhelmed in materials and items to keep track of. To help alleviate this, Elemental Accessory material drops have been moved to Item Level 524. The goal is to reduce how overwhelming it is to start on MT without negatively affecting the experience of those comfortable with our server and our systems.

Class Changes
-------------

#### Berserker

-   Fiery Rage

-   Fixed an issue where during Intimidation, the skill would go on cooldown without providing the effect if canceled or interrupted at a specific frame.

####  Lancer

-   Backstep

-   [PvE]  Added Remnant Evade system, providing a 650ms invincibility duration after casting.

-   Chained Leash

-   Fixed an issue where the skill would not connect to a target when cast at very close proximity.

Design Note: The Remnant Evade system gives a guaranteed invincibility duration regardless of attack speed, resulting in Backstep being significantly more reliable. This is mainly noticeable during Adrenaline Rush and you should no longer die during your Backstep's animation at high attack speed.

####  Mystic

-   Boomerang Pulse

-   Fixed an issue where the healing of this skill could be avoided with an iframe.

-   Note: This does not affect the skill's damage, which can still be iframed.

-   Thrall of Protection

-   [PvP: Champion's Skyring] Fixed an issue where the Glyph of Grounding would not work.

####  Sorcerer

-   Stone Skin

-   Fixed an issue where the skill would go on cooldown without providing the effect if canceled or interrupted at a specific frame.
