# [PvE] Gear Changes

## Elemental Resizing Stones
- You can now dismantle the following items into Elemental Dust:
  - Blazing Necklace Resizing Stone
  - Earth Earring Resizing Stone
  - Marine Ring Resizing Stone
  - Wind Circlet Resizing Stone
- You can use Elemental Dust to exchange for new Resizing Stones of your choosing at a 2:1 ratio.

# [PvE] Dungeon Changes

## Gossamer Vault (Hard)
### Nightmare Gossamer Regent
- (Correction) Reduced the cooldown of the HP drain mechanic by 10 seconds.

## Thaumetal Refinery, Thaumetal Refinery (Hard)
- After starting the fight with Gaaruksalk, a teleportal will appear at the entrance of the dungeon that takes you to the last chamber.

# General Content

## [PvE] Guardian Legion
- Increased contribution gain by 50%.
- Adjusted the auto-balancing of the following bosses when 13 or more players are present:
  - Dreadreaper of Shadow of the Gutrends
  - Vehemos of Escape from Balder‚Äôs Refuge
  - Est of Avenging Talons
  - Ost of Avenging Talons
  - Magnuut of Avenging Talons

## Avenging Talons
- **Est**
  - Reduced HP by 25%.
- **Ost**
  - Reduced HP by 25%.
- **Magnuut**
  - Reduced HP by 25%.

## Escape from Balder‚Äôs Refuge
- **Vehemos**
  - Reduced HP by 50%.

## Shadow of the Gutrends
- **Dreadreaper**
  - Reduced HP by 50%.

- Reduced the delay between Uncommon (green) Guardian Legion missions. This will prevent an occurrence where no uncommon Guardian Legion missions were available.
- Tuwangi Reflexes Training is no longer available.

### Design Note:
We fully anticipated that we‚Äôd need to reel back some of the changes from the last patch, and that‚Äôs exactly what this patch does. Moving some of the HP from the boss itself into the Guardian Legion scaling will help the quieter hours while attempting to keep the fight length during peak hours. The removal of Tuwangi Reflexes Training means that you‚Äôll see more of the other two uncommon missions, which might help fill the gap between the non-flying blue guardians. It‚Äôs very likely we‚Äôll need another round of balancing to hit the sweet spot, and we‚Äôll keep balancing until we‚Äôre happy with how guardians are. And, maybe if there‚Äôs enough long-term interest, we‚Äôll see a custom guardian‚Ä¶üëÄ

# [PvE] World Bosses
- All of Val Kaeli and Val Tirkai are now PK safe.
- Fixed an issue with Perdidrax‚Äôs ‚ÄúTremble!‚Äù attack not properly dealing damage if you are in the skill‚Äôs radius.
- Increased the base respawn timer of all World Bosses from 5 ‚Üí 6 hours.
  - Do keep in mind that all World Bosses also have a random amount of additional time that gets added.
- World Boss drops are now based on the collective damage dealt by the raid. Raids are not competing, but instead reaching a specific damage threshold will unlock better rewards:
  - ‚ÄúTop‚Äù Tier Reward: Respective World Boss Chest
  - ‚ÄúMid‚Äù Tier Reward: Diamond
  - ‚ÄúLow‚Äù Tier Reward: Emerald

### Design Note:
It‚Äôs no secret that farming World Bosses is the go-to method for gearing materials, and we recognize that their frequency is a tad excessive given this fact. Rather than diminishing the rewards by simply reducing the materials obtained, we‚Äôve opted to increase their respawn time slightly. This adjustment will keep World Bosses relevant and rewarding, which should help it coexist with other forms of content rather than compete against them for your time.

# Class Changes

## Archer
- [PvE] Increased overall Skill DMG by 2%.
- **Windsong**
  - Removed a passive which increased Physical Amplification by 5% during the effect.

### Design Note:
We discovered lingering remnants of Patch 93‚Äôs stat scaling passives that were not correctly removed when updating Menma‚Äôs to 64-bit. Despite its long-standing presence, we have decided to remove this passive. The reason behind this decision lies with how Amplification is obtained and scales. As more and more gear releases, this passive will continue getting better and increase Archer‚Äôs damage during Windsong disproportionately. As consolation for this passive being removed, Archer has received an overall damage buff. Consequently, while Archer‚Äôs damage during Windsong is expected to go down, their overall damage output should remain comparable.

## Gunner
- [PvE] Increased overall Skill DMG by 3%.

### Arc Bomb
- [PvE] Increased Skill DMG by 30%.
- Increased Willpower generation upon successful hit from 20 ‚Üí 200.

  - Reduced effect duration from 5 ‚Üí 2.2 seconds

### Bombardment
- [PvE] Increased Skill DMG by 35%.
- [PvE] The missile projectiles have had their hitbox increased by approximately 2 times. This will cause missiles to less frequently miss small bosses that are within the skill‚Äôs radius.

### Burst Fire
- **Velocity Advancement**
  - Increased the Willpower cost from 5 ‚Üí 25.
  - Increased Skill DMG buff from 20% ‚Üí 25%.

### Force Enhancement
- Increased the activation chance of the final rank from 38% ‚Üí 43%.

### Mana Missiles
- [PvE] The additional third missile granted by fully charging the skill deals 200% increased damage compared to the base missiles.
  - Note that in PvP, this skill‚Äôs damage will remain the same.

### Modular Weapon System
- [PvE] Upon casting, applies Glyph of the Swift.

  - Increased effect duration from 5 ‚Üí 6 seconds

### Obliteration

- [PvE] Increased overall Skill DMG by 2%.

### Enhanced Shadow Burst
- Increased Innate CRIT Rate from 1.21 ‚Üí 1.25 times.

### Enhanced Sundering Strike
- [PvE] If Shadow Reaping is inactive, increased Skill DMG by 5%. This normalizes Enhanced Sundering Strike‚Äôs base DMG between in and out of burn which led to abnormally high differences in damage dealt between the two.
  - Note that in PvP, this skill‚Äôs damage will remain the same.

### Shadow Reaping
- Removed a passive which increased Magical Amplification by 5% during the effect.

### Shrouded Escape
- [PvE] Reduced Base Cooldown from 68 ‚Üí 63 seconds.

Just like Archer, we discovered lingering remnants of Patch 93‚Äôs stat scaling passives that were not correctly removed when updating Menma‚Äôs to 64-bit. You can view the Archer design note for more information regarding the reason behind this decision. Much like Archer, we expect Reapers to see their damage during Shadow Reaping go down slightly, but their overall damage remaining the same.

## Slayer

- [PvE] Increased overall Skill DMG during the effect by 4%.
- Removed a passive which increased Physical Amplification by 5% during the effect.

### Design Note:
Just like Archer, we discovered lingering remnants of Patch 93‚Äôs stat scaling passives that were not correctly removed when updating Menma‚Äôs to 64-bit. You can view the Archer design note for more information regarding the reason behind this decision. Unlike Archer, however, Slayer has received an overall damage buff during In Cold Blood, keeping them performing much the same.
