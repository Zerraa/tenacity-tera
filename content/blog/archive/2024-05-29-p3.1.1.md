# Gear Adjustments

## [PvE] Agaia and Elemental Accessories
- You can now use the Uncommon Accessory Morpher to make Agaia and Aether Circlets enigmatic again, allowing you to select new stats.
- Note: You’ll lose any infusion applied to the item(s) as well when doing so.

## [PvP] Impregnable, Harmonic Gear Adjustments
- Fixed an issue where certain weapons did not get the adjustment made in our previous patch.

## [PvE] Dungeon Changes

### Rift’s Edge
- The dungeon now starts from the first main boss Yativio, skipping a fairly large starting section.

#### Yativio
- Reduced HP by 4%.
- Reduced DMG from “Green Spin” attack by 50%.

#### Vesporax
- Reduced HP by 4%.
- Acid puddle DMG increased from 10k → 15k per tick.

#### Koleogg
- Reduced HP by 6%.
- The “Beetle Dust” debuff now reduces HP by 5% every 2 seconds.
- The “Pulse” prior to the shield’s damage has been reduced from 75k → 70k per pulse.
- No longer flies up before entering the shield phase, he will now just perform the shield attack.
- The “Lightning Explosion” attack can now be evaded with any skill that has invincibility frames, rather than being limited to “special evasion” skills such as Feign Death and Warp Barrier.
- Fixed an issue where players would enter the dungeon at an incorrect location in certain circumstances.
- Fixed an issue where a teleportal would take you further in the dungeon than intended.

*Design Note*: Rift’s Edge, essentially a four-boss dungeon, can sometimes feel like a slog. Instead of simply spreading the loot to the first boss (which won’t improve the experience), we decided to start the dungeon directly at Yativio. We’ve also decided to make the dungeon a bit faster, but make certain mechanics hit harder to make it more engaging rather than passive. This’ll allow you to dive into meaningful fights sooner. This change was also influenced by feedback from our community forums which you can join via Discord.

## General Content

## [PvE] Guardian Legion
- Adjusted the following Guardian Legion Mission buffs:
  - **Aura of the Tenacious (Guardian)**: Increases Mana Regeneration from 20 → 100 per second.
  - **Titanic Fury II (Guardian)**: Now provides 5% Cooldown Reduction.
- Massively increased the participant cap of the following Guardian Legion Missions:
  - Avenging Talons
  - Escape from Balder’s Refuge
  - Search & Destroy
  - Shadow of the Gutrends
  - The Rhapsody of Wind and Fire

### Avenging Talons
- **Est**: Increased HP by 2.5x.
- **Ost**: Increased HP by 2.5x.
- **Magnuut**: Increased HP by 3.33x.

### Escape from Balder’s Refuge
- **Vehemos**: Increased HP by 3x.

### Shadow of the Gutrends
- **Elite Gutrend Warrior**: Reduced ATK by 15%.
- **Dreadreaper**: Increased HP by 3x.
- Reduced the contribution gain by half.
  - With the BAMs having more HP, you’ll be able to farm more contribution points (and thus more contribution boxes) from them. We were satisfied with the contribution rate from before, so we’d like to keep it similar. If this turns out to be too aggressive (or not enough), we’ll make further adjustments.

*Design Note*: Last patch, we released our initial experiment with this content being “relevant”. It’s no surprise that we’ve identified some pain points: participation gets capped too early and the main BAMs die too fast. Ideally, we want to find a sweet spot where Guardian Legions during peak hours don’t die in less than 2 minutes, yet can still be reasonably completed during the quieter server hours. We’ll keep our eye on this change and adjust further if necessary until we can reach that point. The increased MP Regeneration and Cooldown Reduction on the Guardian Legion buffs were influenced by feedback from our community forums via Discord.

## [PvE] World Bosses
- **Unstable Bomb of Cooling**: Can no longer be used in the zones where World Bosses spawn.
- Removed the “Protection from Beyond” shield from all World Bosses.

*Design Note*: The shield buff was initially added to encourage players to form raid groups rather than attempting to fight the world bosses solo or with a party. While it successfully achieved this design goal, its implementation allowed for abuse by malicious players. Unfortunately, developing a more robust solution will take a considerable amount of time─ time that we could not allocate for this patch. However, we understand that leaving the issue unaddressed could have negatively affected the experience. Due to this, we have opted to remove the shield this patch rather than leave it in its current state. This system may or may not make a return with a better implementation in the future.

## Achievements
- Disabled the following Ace Dungeon achievements:
  - Caimans Up to Here
  - Catching Them Is the Real Test
  - I Wanna Be the Very Best!
  - Long Time No See
  - Lord of the Hideout
  - Lord of the Labyrinth
  - Nice to Meet You
  - Up to Your Neck in Caimans
- Updated maximum achievement points to account for the aforementioned change.

## Quests
- **Lilith's Trial quest**: “The Finest Fireworks” can no longer be obtained. If you have this quest active, you can choose to abandon it.

## Class Changes

### Brawler
- **Rhythmic Blows**
  - Fixed an issue where casting Rhythmic Blows too soon after Out of Rhythm debuff’s expiry would cause it to reapply the debuff and prevent you from casting the entire skill chain.
  - Reduced the duration of Out of Rhythm from 55 → 54 seconds.

### Gunner
- [PvE] Reverted a change made in our previous patch that reduced overall Skill DMG by 1.5%.
- **Remote Trigger**
  - [PvE] Reverted a change made in our previous patch that increased the cooldown by 1.5 seconds. This means the cooldown has returned to 9 seconds.
- **Time Bomb**
  - [PvE] Reverted a change made in our previous patch that increased the cooldown by 1 second. This means the cooldown has returned to 12 seconds.

### Lancer
- **Stand Fast**: Fixed an issue where the Speed Skating: Retribution EP was not available for selection.

### Sorcerer
- [PvE] Reverted a change made in our previous patch that reduced overall Skill DMG by 2%.

### Valkyrie
- **Godsfall**: Fixed an issue where the second cast’s damage value did not appear. Note: The damage was still applying, but the damage number was not visible.

## [PvP] Civil Unrest
- Fixed multiple issues with the Guild Tower:
  - The minimum distance between towers has been increased to the intended distance (100m).
  - The hitbox has been corrected, which will now prevent you from passing through it with evasion and movement skills. However, you can still teleport through it with Teleport Jaunt.
  - During the latest Civil Unrest (May 26th), we noticed an issue where the Guild Tower’s HP was lower than intended by a bit over 37%. This means that all Guild Towers had their HP reduced from 325 → 204 million.
    - Since the recent move to 20-man raids for Civil Unrest, this change will not be reverted and instead we will monitor the situation and adjust the HP if necessary after we have more data.
  - Fixed an issue where BAMs and Guild Towers did not have their Physical and Magical Resistance set to 999k. This will not affect you if you are using PvP equipment.
  - Added a marker on the map when you are near Rally: Argentus.
