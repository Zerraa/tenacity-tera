[PvE] Dungeon Changes
---------------------

#### Forbidden Arena [Hagufna]

-   Reduced the Infused Ominous Aura effect from Increasing damage taken by 100% â†’ 50%

Design Note: Hagufna is undoubtedly very challenging, especially for players who are not experienced with the dungeon and doubly so if the player is performing the tank role. This adjustment should make the fight much more forgiving, while still preserving the debuff's punishing impact. We'll continue monitoring Hagufna and how parties perform, making further reductions if necessary.

General Content
---------------

#### World Bosses

-   Made a slight adjustment to one of Draelteryx's random spawn options.

Design Note: Despite other achievement-related world bosses functioning normally after we reduced respawn times across the board, Draelteryx remains difficult for players to locate consistently. We've looked into Draelteryx a few times since, and even now there is nothing apparent that would cause any issues. However, one of his six random spawn locations was abnormal compared to the rest. This would normally not be an issue, and is fairly normal for leveling monsters... Regardless, we've adjusted this location slightly to see if this alleviates the problem. It's near the old location, so following existing hunting guides should still be fine assuming all six possible spawns are present.

Miscellaneous
-------------

-   Enabled the following Christmas decorations:

-   Balderon City decorations and Christmas background music

-   UI decorations

-   This can be enabled or disabled through the in-game options menu.

-   Updated character selection to the winter theme.
