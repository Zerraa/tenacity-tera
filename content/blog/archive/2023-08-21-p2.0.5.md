[PvE] Dungeon Changes
---------------------

#### Dreadspire

#### Dark Reach Citadel (Hard)

-   The cage created by Nightmare Theropath now despawns correctly when Theropath is defeated.

#### Lilith's Keep

-   The gates blocking the combat arena while fighting Pyrepelt will now correctly despawn when Pyrepelt is defeated during the "Burn it all!" mechanic.

Class Changes
-------------

#### Archer

-   Fixed an issue where the "Increases Damage of Gust Arrow during Windsong" line [added in the previous patch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10uRDTgw73SW31VpLBvfvSthxDq9uflvhEBK22CHpx1g/edit#heading=h.fycdkvpki27l) was not working correctly.

-   Note: To reiterate, you do not need to select this line on your weapon or the other ones that were added in the previous patch. They automatically apply and do not need to be selected.
