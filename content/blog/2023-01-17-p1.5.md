The last year has been a blast, and we as a team have come a long way from when we first started working on this project. We've learnt a ton, largely in part to your constructive feedback and efforts from the community. 
We're now looking into taking things to the next level in the coming year. This small patch wraps up a number of events, and it also wraps up a few projects started in the previous year including changes to the Island of Dawn and the boss pet system.


More detail will come in the future as things are ironed out, but our plans for the upcoming year include:


* **Creating a new gear set, alongside a new roster of dungeons.**
* **Tidying up existing systems and providing a more streamlined experience for both new and returning players.**
* **Creating additional gameplay loops and systems of progression.**


While previous patches have been rich in the amount of changes made, there are still a few core issues we're looking to address. 
Systems like tailoring and the battle pass event (which we'll be bringing back for sure) have been well received and we're looking to add more content like this, however ultimately previous patches have been largely focused on maintenance rather than growth. 
Ultimately our goal is to grow TERA and make it the best it could be, so we ask for your continued patience and feedback while we work on making exciting new content.


**Serth**
*Content Lead - PvE*

*Note that we also have some dungeon fixes and class adjustments planned, but based on previous feedback we are waiting until the current leaderboard season ends to make any adjustments.*

---------------------

## Dungeon Adjustments
**Sky Cruiser Endeavor (Hard)**
* Improved visual indicator of Darkan’s claw and bomb mechanic.

**Training Ground (Clawrider)**
* Can now be entered as a party.

**Dungeons below level 65**
* Dungeon cooldown now starts instantly when entering Bastion of Lok, Sinestral Manor, Cultist’s Refuge, Akasha’s Hideout, Saleron’s Sky Garden, Labyrinth of Terror, Golden Labyrinth, Ebon Tower, Saravash's Ascent, Necromancer Tomb and Kelsaik’s Nest.

---------------------

## Class Changes
**Ninja**
* Addressed bug where Fire Avalanche sometimes still had 180s cooldown.

**Slayer**

---------------------

**New Boss Companions**
Boss monster companions are now available as extremely rare drops from dungeons! 

* Killing any boss monster will now occasionally drop pet boxes for the entire party, which can be opened for a rare chance of obtaining the pet.
* Hard mode dungeons will drop boxes more often than normal mode equivalents.
* Companions will drop as standard power companions. Players may use Companion Appearance Change Vouchers to reskin existing amplification pets if desired.
* Boss Partners can only obtain the highest levels of their Gifted Skills.

*Note that pet drop rates are by no means final. Our initial rates are conservative by design and we will continue to monitor this over time and make adjustments as necessary.*
*We are also discussing avenues for pity mechanics and adding further pet chances/skins to leaderboard rewards, which may be part of a larger rework to leaderboards and rankings in the future.*
