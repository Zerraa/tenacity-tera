[PvE] Dungeon Changes
---------------------

#### Thaumetal Refinery

-   Fixed an issue where a wall would block players after taking the minecart between the second and third boss.

-   Fixed an issue which caused the "A flower has bloomed somewhere" message to appear despite no flowers spawning.

-   Note: Flowers were not meant to spawn, so the message was removed.

[PvP] Battleground Changes
--------------------------

#### Champion's Skyring

-   Fixed an issue where players could incorrectly receive the party Adrenaline Rush and One with the Sword Cooldown Reduction effects after dying.

-   These effects were [removed from this battleground](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zIO4KdxEulkpv_GxauNsh5WW1IeUiW-HmXsEPcc9neU/edit#heading=h.86ozr2ujwimv) as part of our Patch 2.3-2.

#### Shore Hold

-   Zolyn's HP bar is now visible.

-   Fixed an issue which caused [Battleground] Smilecrackers to not work.
