[PvE] Dungeon Changes
---------------------

#### Dreadspire

-   Challenge #9: Darkan has a new achievement.

-   Kill 100 Ghosts (Darkan's spawns)

-   Rewards title: Ghost Buster

-   Challenge #5: Kelsaik's Shield will no longer clear his debuffs.

-   You now get one Shandra Manaya's Quill for completing the 77x Dreadspire clears achievement.

-   Increased the potency of the buff bosses get after the timer runs out.

Design Note: The changes to the timer are still not intended to be an instant wipe. You can still clutch your runs if the boss is already close to death. However, we don't want you to outlast the buffs- certainly not living 2+ minutes with a "last chance" buff being applied.

#### Antaroth's Abyss (Hard), The Plexus (Hard)

-   Now drops Intact Bloodshard Box

#### Timescape

-   Added a second dragon that splits the Teleport and Flight options.

-   The left dragon will teleport you, while the right dragon will fly you to the mobs section.

#### Rally: Enraged Kumas

-   No longer resets HP after moving too far from its initial spawn.

[PvP] Battleground Changes
--------------------------

#### All Battlegrounds

-   The battleground schedule has been removed.

Design Note: We implemented battleground scheduling as a test to see how it would impact PvP activity. After following feedback posts and seeing the results for ourselves; we feel that it's best left disabled.

#### Leaderboards

-   Overall leaderboard ranking rewards have been adjusted as follows.

##### Champion's Skyring

-   Dawn Box (5x)

-   Dusk Box (5x)

-   Triumph Trophy

-   Dusk Box (3x)

-   Dusk Box (2x)

##### Champion's Skyring, Corsair's Stronghold, Gridiron, Shore Hold

-   Dusk Box (1x)

-   Triumph Trophy is now bankable.

#### Corsair's Stronghold

-   Slightly increased the Defense of both the Anchorstone and Gates.

#### Gridiron

-   Healer requirements changed from 3 → 2~3.

#### Shore Hold

Class Changes
-------------

#### Berserker

-   Fiery Rage

-   Reduced cooldown from 80 → 50 seconds.

-   [PvP] Removed the cooldown adjustment previously implemented in Patch 2.0.

Design Note: We've been following the concerns of Berserker mains lately regarding the [change to Fiery Rage's cooldown](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15jjPdQ6IAVzPMxaBZ7bkcIPlm2Hr0SA6nKSHDkdZvVs/edit#heading=h.6a70rrghabwi) made in Patch 2.0 to increase the Fiery Rage cooldown. We heard you. This change should considerably bring it back and make it far more forgiving to play Berserker.

#### Ninja

-   We've made adjustments to Harmonious Burning Heart to improve reliability and reduce ghosting during the third Harmonious Burning Heart cast per Inner Harmony.

-   Harmonious Boomerang Shuriken, Harmonious Burning Heart, Harmonious Fire Avalanche and Harmonious Leaves on the Wind

-   [PvP] Reduced PvE damage by 30% while in Equalized PvP Gear.

#### Reaper

-   With a Bloodshard weapon equipped, regenerate 500 MP every 3 seconds.

Design Note: This should help the breakpoint of running out of mana without completely removing mana from the game while playing Reaper. We'll continue to monitor Reaper's mana usage and apply additional changes if needed.

General Content
---------------

#### Nexus Mystery Merchant

-   Adjusted the items and prices of items offered by all Mystery Merchants.

Design Note: Nexus Mystery Merchants had two major issues: the items it had weren't all that useful to those who are pushing content, and our prices left a lot to be desired. Although we carefully plotted out the costs to ensure they made the most sense; we made the misstep of balancing this around farming Shadow Sanguinary (Hard) and Dreadspire- which is an unfeasible expectation given the items offered. As such, Nexus Mystery Merchants received another entire overhaul. We will continue to closely monitor their impact, as we don't want Nexus Mystery Merchants to be the "meta" for gearing; just an option.

#### Baldera District

-   Lowered the Knockdown, Sleep and Stun Resistance of mobs.

-   Lowered the Attack of the following mobs or BAMs:

-   Teralith

-   Hydrath

-   Infernal Mage

-   Removed the Regeneration buff from Ruqii and Infernal Mage.

-   Reduced the self buffs that Ruqii and the Infernal Mage can apply:

-   Rage Explosion VI → Rage Explosion III

-   Increases Power by 35% → 20%

-   Strong will VI → Strong Will II

-   Increases Endurance by 35% → 20%

-   Reduced the self buffs that the Elite Zalikari Warrior can apply:

-   Rage Explosion VIII → Rage Explosion VI

-   Increases Power by 45% → 35%

-   Adjusted the trigger radius for allied sentries in the Spring of Arun.

-   Increased the Knockdown Resistance of allied sentries in the Spring of Arun.

Miscellaneous
-------------

-   Adjusted the buy and sale prices of Bespoke Exodor Gear Boxes.

-   Bespoke Exodor Gear Boxes (3 Roll) can now be discarded or sold to merchants for 5,000 gold.

-   Reduced the cooldown of Pet Food and Pet Figurine from 2 seconds → 0 seconds.

-   The Balderon Specialty Merchant now sells Divine Infusions.

Bug Fixes
---------

-   Corrected the buy price of Rejuvenation Potions from the Specialty Merchant.

-   Fixed an issue where Gunner's Gleaming, Resplendent, and Perfected Blooodshard Boots had the incorrect item level.

-   Fixed an issue where Mystery Merchants wouldn't spawn properly.

-   Completing 100 Arun's Legacy Mission Board Quests now properly triggers the achievement.

-   The following weapon costumes now display Bloodshard enchantment effects properly:

-   Arthurian Knight Lance, Balder Staff, Banhammer, Bento Ax, Cantex Photon Shuriken, Couch Killers, Crozier, Dakan Staff, Decarabia Lance, Exodor Staff, Frost Guards Shuriken, Frostrune Axes, Frostrune Bow, Frostrune Scepter, Gargantalon, Guardex Photon Shuriken, Gurgephobia Hammer, Heartbreaker, Jehudiel Lance, Nova Photon Shuriken, Photon Shuriken, Red Dawn Frostrune Shuriken, Royal Frostrune Shuriken, Sabranak Staff, Slingshot, Tarnished Spiral Star, Terror Propeller
