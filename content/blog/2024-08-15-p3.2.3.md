[PvP] Battlegrounds
-------------------

-   The manual vote-kick system has been disabled in all Battlegrounds except Champion's Skyring.

-   Note: From this patch onwards, please report instances of blatant afking and/or trolling to the team via our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mtdream)'s #create-a-ticket channel.

-   Enabled the automatic afk kick system in Champion's Skyring.

-   Note: This is already present in other Battlegrounds.

[PvP] Miscellaneous
-------------------

-   Fixed an issue where owning a Sky Castle would cause gold to be deducted from the owning Guild's bank.
