[Event] Snowbound Sabotage
--------------------------

Event Period: December 12th, 2023 ~ January 16th, 2024

-   Hitting a player with a Snowball now triggers the effect after stacking 20 → 10 times.

-   Increased the duration of the Snowball effect from 30 → 60 seconds.

#### Wintera Snowfield

-   Added a red visual effect to players with the Thermal Layer's shield active.

-   Lowered the cooldown of Hot Cider from 180 → 35 seconds.

-   Removed Stinky Snowpile.

-   Disabled the ability to join an in-progress Wintera Snowfield match.

-   Fixed an issue which caused the Vanguard Request Rewards to revert into last year's rewards.

Class Changes
-------------

-   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Removed passive which provided Cooldown Reduction for skills with a less than 60 second cooldown based on class for Adrenaline Rush (~15%) and Traverse Cut (~7%).

#### Archer

-   Rain of Arrows

    -   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Reverted a previous change which reduced damage of the skill by 15%.

       -   This change is still present on all other battlegrounds.

#### Brawler

-   Divine Wrath

    -   [PvP] Enabled skill in all battlegrounds besides Champion's Skyring.

-   Rhythmic Blows

    -   Replaced a hidden mechanic where the skill's damage was increased based on how low your HP is, with a flat 15% damage increase regardless of HP count.

       -   This results in a ~1.8% damage increase for those playing as DPS role, and a ~0.9% damage increase for those in the tank role.

#### Gunner

-   Arcane Barrage

    -   [PvP] Increased Integration Advancement's damage from 20% → 50%.

        -   This fixes an issue where Arcane Barrage becomes worse during Modular Weapon System by approximately 20%. Now, during MWS it will be better by ~23.5%.

-   Modular Weapon System

    -   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Reduced damage during the effect by 10%.

#### Lancer

-   Adrenaline Rush [March]

    -   Now regenerates 100 RE per second while active.

        -   This will not allow you to cast Guardian Barrier forever.

    -   Improved tooltip.

-   Rallying Cry

    -   [PvP ─ Champion's Skyring] Reverted the previous change to not apply Rallying Cry to allies at all, instead the effect now applies for 3.5 seconds.

    -   This is roughly half the duration of Rallying Cry originally.

-   Wallop

    -   [PvE] Increased innate crit scaling from 1 → 1.21.

        -   This will allow a Lancer's Wallop to crit more consistently while also improving their personal damage output. We'll closely monitor the impact this'll have in a variety of dungeons.
