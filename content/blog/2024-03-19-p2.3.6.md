[Event] Paesyn's Valentines Splash
----------------------------------

-   As of [last patch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ze2Qe6CfqP7No5bkl-cgulTXcB5dN_crIhIGmnQfJx0), no new [Event] Monster Pieces can be obtained but all other portions of the event remained active, dubbed the "Sunset period". This portion of the event will continue until the release of our upcoming major patch.

-   Use this time to fish with the last of your [Event] Monster Pieces, obtain the last [Event] Waterlogged Letters needed for reward(s) you want, or trade with other players!

Classes
-------

#### Gunner

-   Mana Missiles, Obliteration and Time Bomb

-   Fixed an issue which caused the aforementioned skills' projectile speeds to mismatch their intended value.

#### Reaper

-   Cable Step

-   [PvP] Fixed an issue made in a [previous nerf](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ze2Qe6CfqP7No5bkl-cgulTXcB5dN_crIhIGmnQfJx0/edit#heading=h.t7d5izu2qp8b) which erroneously reduced the effectiveness of Shadow Reaping's Cooldown Reduction from 70% â†’ 43% on every skill rather than just Cable Step.
