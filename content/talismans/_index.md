The goal behind Talismans is to bring more freedom and customization into how you choose to engage with the game's combat. More specifically, Talismans allow us the flexibility to fundamentally change how each class can play, without impeding on the gameplay experience of other players. 

It's meant to be a free-form system where players can experiment with any number of combinations to truly fine-tune their playstyle to their preferences.

From a gameplay perspective, Talismans will function similarly to weapon and armor crystals. Various content around the game will have chances to drop Talismans, which players can equip to their gear. effects can vary from simple skill changes, like increased/decreased skill cooldowns, skill damage increases, to more fundamental changes that can affect how an entire class plays, like adding **Propulsion** to certain skills. 
Each tier of gear will increase the number of augment slots needed for equipping Talismans, currently ranging from 1 on **Forgotten** gear to 3 on **Elder**'s gear. 
Talismans can be equipped on both weapon and armor pieces, for a current maximum of up to 6 equipped talismans at a given time.
