**Rally Quest** is a **once-per-daily** Guild Quest associated with Rally boss monsters that spawn throughout Arborea. <br>
**Players can group up together** in a Party or a Raid to defeat Rally monsters to receive rewards based on group-based contribution.<br>

A **global message** is announced for the Rally monster that is about to spawn, along with the announcement the **Guild Quest** becomes available for eligible Guild Members to accept.

All Guilds can accept **[Rally] Guild Quest** as long as weekly Valderon Token limit has not been reached. <br>
Rally Quest can be completed regardless of the amount of contribution as long as a Guild Member has contributed.
