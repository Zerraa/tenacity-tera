To join the battle, players need to talk to [**NPC: Brahem**] who is a GvG Guide in Velika City - walk from the Ring teleport point forward and you will see him right on the right side near some bushes and a Skycastle model in front of him.

### General Info

</center>

To enter and build a tower you a guild need to complete **weekly guild quest** to get enough Valderon tokens.Depending on the Guild size, the amount of Valderon tokens will change.

{{< callout context="info" >}}
Small guild -> needs **700** from 900 max<br>
Medium guild -> needs **1100** from 1300 max<br>
Large guild -> needs **1500** from 1700 max
{{< /callout >}}

Character who builds the tower needs correct **permission** or be a *guild master*. <br>
Guild also needs to have least 5 members with character's level over 65 online and inside CU when it starts or guild tower auto-destructs when event starts and they won't get reward. 

To win the CU guild must defend their tower and destroy other guilds' towers.  <br>
Score depends on **tower and player kills**.If you happen to die in the war zone, you can respawn near your guild’s tower, or the in starting area (if tower is destroyed).  

Winners get honour and glory, also **Tanner lion** mount for one week (speed 280, but useable in CU area too). **Top 3 guilds get golden, silver and bronze lining** on their guild icon on title.

**While in the Civil Unrest area, weapon skins and other costumes cannot be used and every player will wear an unified costume.** This is to improve the game performance so you dont need to worry about it too much.

#### Essentials

</center>

Before the actual start of Civil Unrest you would prefer to stack on needed potions which you can buy from **Smuggler** inside of the area. You can also buy **Painkillers** from him which are very useful in bigger battles that you will face! In addition, there are items such as **Poison** which when used will kill your character immediately (as they deal 1.000.000 flat damage).

Its recommended to always have some Poison on you, as it makes regrouping much easier. If the respawn point is too far, running back can take a long time - therefore it is recommended to use poison to kill yourself and **to return to Dock (Civil Unrest enterance)** or choose to go back **to the Guild Tower** location.

You will also need a **different mount**, which you can buy from Merchant in any major city. Winners of previous Civil Unrest can also use their **Tanner** mount, which can be ridden inside of Civil Unrest and is generally faster than a basic horse mount.
