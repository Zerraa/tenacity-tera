## Basic

Each party will have [5] people: [1] Tank and at least [1] Healer.<br>
Each dragon will be manually enraged after engage. Afterwards [dragons enrage every 15%] of non-enraged HP.

### Debuff Mechanic

There are 4 colored circles  (White, Red, Orange and Yellow), each with a dragon. <br>Fighting inside this area will every 15seconds apply a stack of same colored debuff. 
White/Aquadrax ![:aquadrax_debuff:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/777145915916025866.webp?size=44&quality=lossless) Orange/Ignidrax ![:ignidrax_debuff:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/777145931233230858.webp?size=44&quality=lossless) Yellow/Terradrax ![:terradrax_debuff:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/777144891859795999.webp?size=44&quality=lossless) Red/Umbradrax ![:umbradrax_debuff:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/777145944701141002.webp?size=44&quality=lossless)

At the beginning,each party will already have assigned dragon to start and which direction will the full raid rotate. (clockwise) First stack of debuff is automatically applied after **first 10seconds** in the circle.<br><br>
**[If you arent in any circle once the first or any other stack is applied, you will automatically die.]**
If any of the dragons has no alive players inside of the circle, he will start healing himself and other dragons.

### Shield Mechanic

Around 8 stacks or 2minutes into the fight, dragons will do a shield mechanic. It’ll be advised by a message saying **“Dragons summon Vergos”**.

Break the shield and move quickly to the next circle.Your stacks will probably be on 9.

### Killing All Dragons + Timer Starts

Having **10 stacks of any color will automatically kill you** and you won't be able to resurrect for the whole phase.

Parties who have killed the first dragon should rotate to the next dragon and help killing it, then keep rotating.

After the first dragon has been killed, a 60s timer starts with the message "Dragons are getting angrier!". <br>
After 30s, you will get another message saying **"Dragons will be enraged in 30 seconds"**. All dragons still alive when the timer has run out will gain massive damage and attack speed buff.

With **60s timer after first dragon is killed**,DPS should be careful so the HP difference of dragons isnt too high.

Optimally, each party should do 25-30% dps per rotation, but some might do more some might do less. The **difference should never get too big** (ex. 2%HP white dragon and 40%HP red dragon).
