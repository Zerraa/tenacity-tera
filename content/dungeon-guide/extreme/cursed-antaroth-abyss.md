## Boss: Cursed Antaroth
Dungeon is very simillar to AAH before, only few new mechanics were added.

### Key Mechanics

#### 95% Laser(s)

Starting at 95%, the boss can target a random person with 2 types of lasers.  
● One laser the boss will slap you first then laser.  
● One he will just laser immediately.

Heres an example of a **raw laser, much faster timing**. Blue circle under primary target.  
The blue streak on the floor beneath the primary target is your tell to press iframe.

#### 60% Purple Magic

The Red magic mechanic will change into this at 60% and he will do it immediately at 60%.<br>**The difference here is in the donuts at the end.**

#### 70% Orb Mechanic
- (2 minute 30 cd)

The biggest changed mechanic from the old version.The boss will teleport to the center of the room and **his sword will glow a certain color**, either red or blue.<br>This determines the floor color for the rest of the mechanic.

{{< callout type="error" >}}
**The bosses sword is in his right hand:**<br>
● **Glowing RED** -> The left side of the boss will be red colored, the right side colored blue. <br>
● **Glowing Blue** -> The left side of the boss will be blue, the right side will be red.
- Sword color = opposite side color for short.
{{< /callout >}}

![](https://i.imgur.com/IICmAf2.png)

To make this mechanic extra annoying, any remaining orbs will then buff the boss resistance in certain ways: 

{{< callout type="error" >}}
● Each **blue orb** will increase **magic resist by +10k** and **reduce phys resist by -5k**  
● Each **red orb** will increase **phys resist by +10k** and **reduce magic resist by -5k**
{{< /callout >}}

There are many ways to deal with this depending on group composition.

<br>

<center>
<table>
   <tbody> 
      <tr>
        <td>Version 1</td>
        <td>Version 2</td>
      </tr> 
      <tr>
         <td><video width="320" height="240" controls>
              <source src="https://i.imgur.com/9Cn9py0.mp4" type="video/mp4">
             </video>
         </td>
         <td><video width="320" height="240" controls>
              <source src="https://i.imgur.com/mneOoVs.mp4" type="video/mp4">
             </video>
         </td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>
</center> 

Now anyone on each side will be given that color debuff,using above as an example, the people on the sword side will be given blue debuff, the arm side people will be given red.
* 8 Orbs will then spawn in a fixed position based on the boss.Determined by where hes facing.

  {{< card title="" image="https://i.imgur.com/2yox4YI.png" subtitle="Tactic 2" >}}
{{< /cards >}}

You will need to break one of these orbs to survive the aoe the boss is charging up.<br>  
Breaking the orb while standing near it will give you an **immune shield for 3 seconds**, gotta time it with the boss attack.<br>  
Timing this is really easy when viewing the bosses attack on the floor. **Red runes will be begin appearing on the floor, thats your queue to break an orb.**
 
#### 40% Cage
Finally at 40% the boss will teleport to the middle, greatly slowing everyone **(healer cleanse this)** and put a cage up.
  
The boss will then **give himself 3 different color buffs** (instead of players like the old one) and **you must remove all 3 buffs from the boss before the cage completes its 3rd rotation.**<br>

**For example** the boss can spawn with 8 red, 1 yellow, 1 blue. 
* If all 5 people stand in the red slice for the first hit, it will make it have 3 red, 1 yellow, 1 blue.<br>  
Likewise if you stand in a color after it has been removed, it will be re-added to the boss.  
If all that remains is 2 blue and nothing else, either stand in blue or stand in **white (nothing)**

### Basic Attacks

**Pushback on aggro**
Use kaia or rally to prevent knockback.

<center><video height="246" width="604" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/JFmLo4k.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Slap and Pushback**

Something new is he will slap the tank,and then swing his sword, both hits are blockable.

* Now **if the boss pauses and swings his sword** around his body, this will push you back and apply a nasty bleed (cleanse).

</video></center>

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**In resonance beyond level 31** the boss can have a a bonus affix where **he is not required to stun check**, he will spin regardless at every opportunity.
{{< /callout >}}

**Double Underhand Combos**<br>
* If the boss does **back to back underhand hits (1-2 followed by 1-2 again immediately)** he will do one of two things now, either back stun or tank push.  
* If anyone is hit for a stun at any point in this fight, he will spin **(dodge it).**
  * Stun is removable if the healer is fast enough and he wont count it.

**Front Stun into Back Stun**<br>
This mechanic is entirely random. Will trigger stun check if any players remain stunned.

  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/4YUCDi9.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Jump Stun**<br>
Will jump on a random target and stun, spin checks if any players remain stunned.

<center><video height="246" width="604" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/1uHkXag.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Backstep into spin or front/back stun**<br>
Again completely random, the boss can backstep then do one of two attacks.Either he will do front/back stun or a spin.

### Special attacks

**Stacking Slap Debuff**
Something new is when the boss does the orb slaps, **either on laser targets or just on the tank**, **he will gain a blue buff that stacks 4 times** total.<br><br>
Only when the **orb/slap color is purple** will it give a stack, if the orb/slap is blue no stack is added.

| Icon | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/JO5LxJK.png) | Does an area-wide spin that applies bleeding and does damage when reaches 4 stacks. |

{{< callout type="error" >}}
**When reaching 4**, he will do a giant blue spin that does alot of damage, bleeds, and pushes back across the room.
{{< /callout >}}

#### 90% Red Magic 
- 70 second cd

{{< callout context="info" >}}
Exactly the same as the old one, the boss will do a 4 stage attack:  
● Stab  
● Spin  
● Half room AoE  
● Donuts
{{< /callout >}}

There are a total of 5 donut pulses so iframe out once the 4th appears.<br>
The spin will either be to the left or the right which determines the direction of the following steps.  

![](https://i.imgur.com/6R1EYnx.png)

{{< callout context="warning" >}}
● If the boss swings/spins to the left, go left  
● If the boss swings/spins to the right, go right 
{{< /callout >}}

**This will make you safe from the 3rd attack, the half room aoe.**<br>Finally the donuts are also determined by the direction of his spin.

#### Mana Drain
- 2 min ish cd

2 minutes into combat and then roughly every 2 minutes again, the boss will do a mana drain hitting the entire room.
* **Healers can dispell this instantly.**

<center><video height="246" width="604" controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/NoboMGg.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

Likewise all the bosses special abilities will give you a debuff that is a number, the more you get hit, the higher the number, ranging from 1-5.  
* This number will make you take increased damage, stacking higher the more you get hit.  

When the boss casts the mana drain, you will take bonus damage based on if you have a number debuff and how high it is.
If you have no number, you will take zero damage but if you have 5 expect to get one shot or nearly one shot from the mana drain.
