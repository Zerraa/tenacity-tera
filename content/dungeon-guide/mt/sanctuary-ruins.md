### Key Mechanics

* **Debuff** - Players with this debuff will have an eye floating above them, and they will also bleed 3% of max HP every second. This debuff lasts 4 minutes, and if you get this debuff twice, you will die.
* **Spread** - While stunned, a large circle will form around each player, which inflicts 50k damage each, so make sure to spread out. 
* **Gather** - Everyone must gather up quickly as those bombs will explode in a donut AoE around them. Players must gather fast and healers must cleanse immediately, or else anyone not cleansed will detonate and cause a massive AoE damage.

After 40 seconds of combat, Lakan will float and say: 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“I mark you!”
{{< /callout >}}
<br>
        
He will do this mechanic every 1 minute unless he says **“I am no mere mortal foe!”**

<h4>Pattern Reversal (<50% HP)</h4>
When Lakan’s HP falls below 50%, a system message will appear again, but the order of the Chaos Mechanic pattern will now be **REVERSED**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gDt78d7.png)
* Note: Keep in mind that this message will be randomized!

<h4>FEEL THE ICY TOUCH OF MY EMPTY SOUL… (<30% HP) </h4>

![](https://i.imgur.com/W0rIwNv.png)

Randomly under 90% , he will float in air and say 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“Feel the icy touch of my empty soul!”
{{< /callout >}}
<br>   
      
There will be a ring closing in toward Lakan, which inflicts deadly damage.**Iframe it.**
* DO NOT go near him after avoiding the ring.

* When this 5 second buff timer icon (see image on right) appears, healers must use their dispell skill to prevent Lakan from creating a shield.

<h4>LAKAN’S SOUL WORLD</h4>

![](https://i.imgur.com/bXqMvRS.png)

When Lakan’s **HP falls below 30%**, you will notice that Lakan is now silvery, and the arena has turned blue.

* All Chaos mechanics will be the inverse.

<h4>Soul Saturation Gauge</h4>
Whenever Lakan initiates Soul World, this gauge will **fill up by 25** each time.
<h4>UNDO the Soul World</h4>
Lakan will also UNDO soul world with the quote: **“Ha! Not bad!”** This time, you must **SLEEP** (not plague/regress) Lakan.

![](https://i.imgur.com/jBHCdyv.png)

**I pity your allies** - If someone dies throughout the fight, the Soul Saturation meter will go up by **+5**, this has a cooldown, but will repeat if the person stays dead and does not ressurect fast enough.

### Basic attacks

**Sword (chop) – Shield (smash) – Sword (R swing) – Back Spin (cone) – Sword (thrust)** - 
* On the third part when he swings his sword from right to left, he will pause very briefly before he backspins like Darkan, but this time, there will be a large cone attack.<br>

**Sword (chop) – Shield (smash) – Sword (L cross) – Shield (stun) – Back Kick (cone)** -  
* On the third part, he will swing his sword to form an X shape starting with Left diagonal slash then Right. 
* Then he will lift his shield and slam it upright on the ground, creating small AoE that stuns anyone near him, then he will immediately follow up with a back kick that covers large cone AoE behind him.<br>

**Shield (smash) – Sword (chop) – Sword (R cross) – Shield (cone)** - 
* On the third part, he will swing his sword to form an X shape starting with Right diagonal slash then Left.
* Cone on last hit with Shield will cause 5 wave AoE, starting with 10m radius circle, then 10~20m donut, 20~30 donut, 30~40 donut and 40~50 donut. 

**Shield Rally – Sword (R cross)x3 – Sword (stabs)** -  When he strikes his shield it does nothing, but it tells you that he will start slashing like a maniac.

**Random Target Claw Patterns** - The claw attack itself is a 2 hit attack. Lakan will charge energy into his sword and then throw it, splits into 3, leaving a claw mark on the ground, then he will retrieve it after a moment. 
* **Stop – Face random target – Claw** <br>
He just pauses shortly and turns around to face random target.<br>
This occurs mostly due to res bait.
* **Backswing Turn – Face random target – Claw** <br>
He makes a large swing as he turns around, then faces toward random target. <br>
To add, this tends to target farthest person who is within ~17m radius.
* **Shield (Slam) – Laser (from his shield) – Backswing Turn – Face random target – Claw** <br>
His shield glows pink and attacks by thrusting his shield forward. He will pause briefly as the shield’s glow is concentrated and shoots a laser. 

### Special attacks

**Double 5-way shot** - He will curl up with a small puddle under him, then launch 5-way projectile around him

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“You cannot defend against me.”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>

<center>

</center>

* There are several ways to trigger this:

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
1) Person with aggro dies<br>
2) Person with aggro is too far away (~8m?)<br>
3) Person with aggro loses aggro<br>
3) When he does or undoes soul realm
{{< /callout >}}
<br> 

* Healers can prevent this with res bait.

**Circle or Donut** - A quote will pop up in the middle of the screen:
{{< callout type="info" >}}
“Begone!”
{{< /callout >}}
<br>
 
With a large sword swing motion, he will spin around with either Red or Purple swipe surrounding him. 
* **Purple swipe** - He will place a Circle AoE (~8m); **stay away** from him.

* **Orange swipe** - He will place Donut AoE (8m~20m); **hug** him.

**Let's see just how clever you are...** - IN into Donuts depending on which world Lakan is currently inside of.

A message will popup on the screen **Let's see just how clever you are...** and Lakan will hit the tank first, then turn on the dps and do an **ORANGE** cone shaped hit with his shield, then kick the back. Right after he will turn back towards the tank and do a donut mech.

Its recommended for the tank to stay on the back of the boss to **block the kick** for the dps that will come as the boss turns towards them.

- NORMAL -> IN, Orange Donuts (coming from IN OUT)
- SOUL WORLD -> OUT, Blue Donuts (coming from OUT IN)

If Lakan does a **PURPLE** cone shaped hit as he turns towards the dps, his next attack will be different.

**Are you afraid of me?** - Lakan will hit the tank twice, first with an **ORANGE cone shaped attack and then PURPLE one**. Then proceed with donut attacks.

Lancers are able to use **Divine Protection** to grant immunity against the damage of inner hit.

**Run... If you can.** - Lakan will quickly attack the tank, after a fast double slash attack, he will slam the shield on the ground which will **stun** if not blocked and then kick the back which has to be avoided or iframed.

He will continue attacking the tank, his mechanic then changes depending on if he hits with his **SHIELD** or **SWORD**.

- Shield -> IN
- Sword -> OUT

**Donut Attack** - Lakan will slash the tank and then slowly smash the ground with his shield. This attack is simple to see as the shield hit is way slower than the rest of his animations. 

Mechanic changes through the fight depending on his HP.
