## First Boss: Kalavese

Tank in the middle of the room to make the run a lot more smooth to deal with a Key Mechanic mentioned later.

### Key Mechanics

**Spinning In-Out** - Cannot be blocked and iframed. A text indicator will show up saying: 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“I’ll burn you to ashes”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>
     
The boss stars spinning and will either attack in an inner donut or an outer donut first, followed by the other one.
* The way to tell which attack he will do first you have to **look at his spin**. He either spins slowly with no indicator or he spins fast with a wind forming around him.

- **Slowly and no wind:** Go out and then go in
- **Fast and wind forming:** Go in and then go out
  - You need to be at least 9 meters away from the boss when he does the inner circle.

**Fire Pits and Debuffs** - First it’s important to recognize what the map looks like. In the middle of the map there’s 4 big circles and 4 smaller circles.
* A text indicator will show up saying : 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Kalavese is spraying flammable liquid”
{{< /callout >}}     
* Followed by 1 or 2 people, excluding the one having aggro, will get a **debuff which needs to be removed within 45 seconds**. 
  * Failure to do so will result in an explosion dealing damage to the entire party and giving them a uncleansable bleed. 
  * This deals 100% of hp to the person exploding and 50% to everyone else. 
* While you can survive this with a great healer, it’s not recommended at all.

</video></center>

To remove this debuff you need to get hit by 1 of the 4 Fire Pits.
* This big circle slowly fills until it erupts and clearing the people inside of it of the debuff. The smaller circles don’t have any real purpose except for making it more visible to see which Fire Pit will erupt.

### Basic attacks

**Frontal Attack** - Usual simple pinch smash.

**Frontal 7 smash** - This attack pushes back the tank, as mentioned before.. It’s ideal to tank the boss in the middle.
* **Hard Mode and Enrage:** He starts with 2 hits attack before doing the 7 atacks.

### Special attacks

**Turn and Back attack** - Boss turns around to attack the players behind him.
* When the boss turns he’ll attack one additional time by turning and then puking on the DPS, this is not iframable but needs to be moved out range from.
  * If someone gets hit by this attack he will then fart on the Tank before turning back which needs to be iFramed.

**Jump** - Boss jumps in the air and comes dropping down, hitting all around the boss.
* When the boss comes down and he’s Enraged, he’ll do a spin which needs to be moved out of or else he’ll target that person with a one shot jump.

## Second Boss: Thormemtum
### Key Mechanics

**Catapults** - During this boss fight there’s 4 catapults, in normal mode all 4 of them will use the same ammunition, in hard mode it’s a bit different.
* At 90% the first catapult will start firing, then at **every 20% hp increment another one** will start firing. (So at 90%, 70%, 50% and lastly at 30%)

* At 70% the East Catapult will start firing, this one fires suicide bombing Caimens. When it first hits the ground it will just remain there, when a player gets close it will then start following that person and then explode when it comes close.
  * A healer should go get the aggro from these Caimen and pull them away from the DPS and Tank, you can iframe away from the aoe before it explodes.
* At 50% the South Catapult will start firing, this one fires poison puddles which slowly grows bigger before exploding inflicting damage, a silence and a slow.
* At 30% the West Catapult will start firing bombs that will fire a laser horizontally and vertically at the same time, dealing 70% people’s max hp if you get hit.

### Basic attacks

**Frontal Smash** - Pulls his arm back to slam the tank.

**Frontal Slam** - Lifts his disc in the air and slams it down on the tank.

**Double Frontal Spam** - Lifts his arm into the air and thn slams with his disc

**Slam and Spin** - Slams his fist on the tank and then rotates to slam his disc down

**Disc spin** - His heart lights up and then he spins his disc around himself dealing damage to the entire party
* Can be blocked

**Spin slam behind** - He spins and then rotates to slam down someone behind the boss. Usually targets the player furthest away from the boss
* **Healer:** You can go behind the tank to avoid the boss turning too much.

### Special attacks

**Frontal slam v2** - The boss’ heart lights up and he’ll then slam the tank, this **needs to be iframed**. 
* Failure to do so will make the tank do his spin attack, almost certainly killing the tank.

**If you Iframed**:

</video></center>

**Gun Fire front or back** - Thormemtum’s rocket in his chest will light up in red and he’ll fire at the tank. If you get hit by this the catapults will start targeting you.
* Can not be iframed, move to the side of the boss.
  * If it lights up as red it will fire at the tank, if it stays in this animation for a second it’ll turn and fire behind him.

**Disassemble and Spin** - A text indication will show up on your screen saying : 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“Thormemtum summons vortex.”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>
     
* This time you need to get away from the boss because if you get hit the boss will spawn Tornados which will launch you up in the air.

**Triple Hit Pull** - The boss will slam his hand on the ground three times in quick succession, getting hit by the 3rd attack will pull you to the front of the boss followed by an attack doing 60% HP damage. 
* Iframe just before you see the third ground slam. 
* **Getting hit by this will give you the debuff that make the Catapults target you.**

## Last Boss: Argog

A lot of the attacks in this boss fight will involve Argog teleporting onto players and doing an AOE attack on them, so it’s very important that players spread out when the boss does these types of attacks.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
* This boss fight exists of 2 phases in Normal mode and 3 in Hard mode.
  * In Hard Mode the second phase will start at 80% and the third phase at 30%.
* **Second and third phase will be called “True Form” in this guide.**
{{< /callout >}}

### Key Mechanics

**Argog reveals his true himself** - Indicated by a text message saying 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“Argog reveals himself.”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>      
     
* This is a lot like the Stun mechanic mentioned in Special Attack, however here he crouches longer and you can use his fangs as an indication on when to iframe.
* **Lancers: A lancer can use his Guardian Barrier to block the aoe, resulting in nobody having to iframe.**

**Argog is on the hunt** - A text message will appear saying 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“Argog is on the Hunt”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>
     
He will then dissappear and teleport to each player individually. **Make sure to spread out**. 
* Iframe when you see smoke appear under your character, this indicates he wil target you for the next attack.
