## First Boss: Hemera
### Key Mechanics

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Your tank must bring the boss one of the spheres around the room.<br>
Position the boss so DPS can hit the boss without hitting sphere.
{{< /callout >}}

<br>

**Spheres and Shield** - When entering the room, you’ll be faced with Hemera and by default, it is protected by a reflective shield. 
* Players will receive 10% maximum HP as damage when attacking Hemera with an active shield.

* Once the sphere dies, it will release an aura that will deal 10,000 damage a second and you will need to move onto the next.

      2. North West

* This sphere will periodically debuff players with a damage over time and the same Bleed/Sleep effect as the mini game. <br>
It is not recommended to use this sphere, unless needed.

      1. North East (Recommended 1st)

* This sphere will periodically place the Ring from the mini game onto the target with the highest aggro. <br> 
This will deal damage to anyone who is mid-range to that person. 

      3. South West (Recommended 2nd)

* This sphere will periodically place the Circle from the mini game onto the person with the highest aggro. <br> 
This will deal damage to anyone who close-range to that person. The person selected will still be damaged.

      4. South East

* This sphere will periodically debuff players with a damage over time and the same Bleed/Sleep effect as the mini game. <br>
It is not recommended to use this sphere, unless needed.

**North West / South East spheres** - Spheres will occasionally give Hemera a 5 second buff that will need to be Plagued/Regressed. Failure to remove this buff will give Hemera a substantial power buff for 30 seconds.<br>

### Basic attacks

**Tail Whip** - Hemera’s rotation includes two consecutive tail whips. <br> 
**Dive** - From time to time, Hemera will rise up slightly, stagger all nearby players and then slam the ground.
* Make sure to iframe.

**Electric Ball** - Hemera will fire an electric ball which inflicts heavy damage at a player.
* Make sure to iframe.

**Triple Electric Ball** - Hemera will sometimes fire three electric balls at a player. This is notified by the purple secondary aggro ring.

### Special attacks

**Thunderstrike** - Hemera will shout 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“We will meet again!”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>   
      
* And spread his wings, and then proceed to fly up. You must interrupt him before he flies by **stunning her**. 
* Failure to do so will cause him to hail a deadly attack by flying upwards and spitting 3 fire explosions in a line directly in front of him.
* When he lands, he will also deal a moderately high amount of damage.

**Out Take** - Hemera will flap his wings and pushes players outwards with strong wind currents.

## Second Boss: Tempas
### Key Mechanics

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Tank the boss against the wall or circular motion.<br>
However, the tank must be able to get out and avoid the breath.
{{< /callout >}}

<br>
     
**Storm Incarnate** - Tempas shouts

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“Fools! I am the storm incarnate!”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>
     
And then jumps, this causes a shockwave across the field.<br>
* Inflicts a fixed amount of damage and a MP decaying debuff which can be cleansed. 
* Second or two later after Tempas lands, multiple Kuma Statues will fire lightning bolts at players so be prepared to dodge.

**Tempas’s Statues** - When an Electric Sphere touches a statue, it will activate the statue. The statue will then fire a streak of lightning across the room at the closest player.
* You can also stun or CC the statues.

### Special attacks

**Electric Spheres** - Spheres will float around the field, usually on the outer edges.
* They can be destroyed but it is not recommended as DPSing the boss would be much faster.

**Jump** - Tempas will jump and slam onto the ground.This will send players into the air if not outright oneshotting you.
* Make sure to iframe.

**Breath** - Tempas will deal an electric breath attack at a player.
*  The breath attack will leave three electric puddles on the ground.
*  This debuff will give you an aura which can damage nearby party members. This can be cleansed. Getting hit will generate an Electric Sphere.

{{< callout type="error" >}}
Both puddle, breath and debuff aura will deal very high damage.

## Final Boss: Valona
When entering the room, you’ll notice that the floor is split into 3 parts. An Inner Ring, Center Ring and Outer Ring.<br> 
They’ll move around when you first encounter a boss. 

### Key Mechanics

* These are the **Sun** tile, **Devil** tile and **Goddess** tile. (Do not be confused by the floating cubes, pay attention to the walls).
* During the fight, one of the walls will light up, the Sun will glow red, the Devil will glow purple and the Goddess will glow green. <br>

Your party must then cooperate and align the floors so that they are facing the appropriate wall.
* All three floor’s alignment pieces must be facing that wall.
* Successfully completing one of these will give your party members a buff that lasts until the timer ticks zero again.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
* Sun: Regenerates HP over time. Stamina does not decrease.
* Goddess: Increases Defense.
   * Restores the HP+MP to 100% and allowing dead players to revive.
* Devil: Restores 100% MP every 15 seconds.
{{< /callout >}}
<br>
     
**Rotating and aligning the floors** - During the fight, a wall will glow it’s respective color.
* **Outer Ring** - The outer ring can be rotated by destroying a Time Device on the outer edges of the map.
* Destroying one will rotate the outer floor once in a clockwise motion. **(Devil > Goddess > Sun > Devil)**. <br>
![](https://i.imgur.com/jAX5xVP.png)

Destroying all **3 Time Devices** will announce :  

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“The World Seal draws upon the power of the worlds.”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>  
      
* After five seconds, Yana receives a buff which increases its defense and party members will receive a deadly DoT. 
* Healers should cleanse the party and Plague/Regress Yana.

**Middle Ring** - Yana will shout :

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“Open your mind to all of time and space!”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>
     
And proceed with a ring shape explosion on the center ring.

* When a player stands inside this attack, they must take damage and survive, then the middle ring will rotate counter-clockwise **(Sun > Goddess > Devil > Sun)**. 
* In order for players to survive, players must **share the damage by standing in** the damage zone together. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/Gm0EglZ.png)

**Inner Ring** - You’ll notice another bar when fighting Yana.This bar can fill up to 100.
* This bar will fill up when you attack the boss.
* When the bar is full, “A Stone Sigil Becomes Active” will be shown and you will be able to interact with Yana (by pressing “F”).
* This will rotate the inner ring clockwise **(Devil > Goddess > Sun > Devil)**.

### Failing Core mechanic

**Yana will receive a specific buff depending on which wall is glowing.**<br>
It is not recommended that you fail any and it’ll make the fight harder.

**Swipe** - Yana will swipe to a side.

**Front clap** - Claps in front towards the tank. Hits twice.
* Dodge all the claps to unlock an achievement.

**Dice Attacks** - Yana will use his dice to attack players, combos include smashing them in front and them behind and throwing them at the person with the highest aggro. 

**Spin** - Yana will spin around and proceed to juggle its cubes, spinning them at high speeds around it. 
* This can deal a lot of damage and potentially kill melee players, so it is best to avoid this by escaping.

**Leash** - From time to time, if no players are nearby, Yana will leash a player saying :

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“Come closer, little mote!”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“Who are you to touch my statue?”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>
     
And attempt to mix up the floor.You must interrupt her by **stunning**.<br>
* Failure to do so will cause Yana to slam his dice into the ground, moving either the Outer or Inner Ring once. 

**Black Hole** - Yana will place a black hole on a player and will stay on the ground for a while. 
* Entering this black hole will cause players to be teleported to a Time Device on the outer edges of the field.

* Yana will say : 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“Come, my beautiful children!”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>
       
To announce them spawning in soon.

**Time Cage** - You will be notified with : 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“Who is so bold as to enter my realm?”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>
      
* And a purple cage will appear around the inner floor ring. Next she will say : 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
“My power has been gathering in this realm!”
{{< /callout >}}

<br>  
      
* And proceed to eject mass amounts of energy, killing anyone still left inside.
