## Boss: Gardan

### Key Mechanics

#### Glowing Fist AoE

Starting at **80% then every 70-80 seconds**, the boss will stand straight and his right hand will glow either red or blue and he will slam it, creating donuts to dodge.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Red Fist** = Coming from Inner First<br>
**Blue fist** = Coming from Outer First
- 4 waves of donuts will spawn moving quickly.
{{< /callout >}}

<br>

{{< callout type="error" >}}
[HARD MODE] At 45%, Inner and Outer Donuts patterns speeds up considerably.
{{< /callout >}}

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Both of these are actually easier to dodge if you go 2 donuts out/in.<br>
If its **Red**, go to 14m.<br>
If its **Blue**, go to 10m.
{{< /callout >}}

#### Increasing Power

At **70%** the boss will gain this buff, increasing his damage done by 2%. 
* This will **stack every 60 seconds** for the rest of the fight.
* This is **removable with plague/regression**.

#### 65% Unleash

Once below 65%, the boss will begin casting an unleash. 
* This will also create a cage that will limit the amount of space you have.
* Once in unleash, the boss will gain a buff: 

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/804308617703850014/804328760241160232/unleash_power_increase.png)

This gives him 20% movement speed and 30% attack speed.
* The boss in unleash is entirely combo based and the unleash will not end until he reaches a certain amount.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The **First Unleash** goes like this:<br>
- 3x Right - Left - Right hits **(Blockable)**<br>
- 3x Rampages (dodge the 3rd hit, hurts) OR Whirlwind **(Blockable)**<br>
- Shout ( cannot prevent this damage, heal through)
{{< /callout >}}

If he Starts the combo with Left hand = Rampages<br>
if he Starts the combo with Right hand = Whirlwind. 

<br>

</video></center>

* If his target dies or he changes targets, he will restart this combo!<br>
He must get **3 finishers off to exit unleash**, the finishers are the 3rd rampage or the whirlwind followed by a shout. 

During this, the giant will still spit snowballs at people with the 45 second debuff, place these out of the stack.<br>
After exiting unleash, all of the bosses cooldowns will be up similar to Lumikan so prepare for everything back to back.

#### 35% Unleash

The Second Unleash will gain some new stuff added to it.
* If everyone **stays near the boss**, he will **only target the tank** like the first unleash.
* If people are **far away enough from the boss**, he will instead **target them or a random person** with a focus target. 

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/804308617703850014/804331183705817168/unleash_focus_target.png)

This means the boss will focus that player for his entire combo or until they die.
* The person with this eye needs to quickly go to the tank and **let the tank block** for them.

It can be quite messy especially with snowballs still coming from the giant on the wall.
* The bosses combo will also be longer this time around.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The **Second Unleash** goes like this:<br>
- 3x Right - Left - Right<br>
- 3x Rampages  OR  Whirlwind<br>
- 1x Beast fury  (5-6 hits and the final hit **kds through block**)<br>
- Shout
{{< /callout >}}

* If his target dies or he changes targets, he will restart this combo!<br>
In order for the boss to exit unleash, he will **need to do 3 total shouts** after finishing a combo. 

#### 1% Final Unleash

Finally at 1%, the boss will go immune to damage and cast his final unleash.
* This unleash will never end until he dies or you do.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/804308617703850014/804334522614939668/shield_buff.png)

He also gains a **shield** for 700k that you must first break through before finishing his hp.
The final unleash will **ALWAYS** trigger a focus debuff on someone after shouting.
* Unlike the other unleashes, the boss will start this one with a shout which applies the focus target on a random person. 
* **Anytime the combo string ends the shout will apply it again randomly to any person in party, excluding healers.** 

{{< callout type="error" >}}
[HARD MODE] The shield here is effectively another 10% of the bosses max hp you need to burn at the hardest part.<br>
Also **every time the boss shouts**, either from someone dying or finishing a combo string, it will spawn a wave. **Deals more damage and applies ice stack, not worth avoiding but more heal/cleanse intense.** 
{{< /callout >}}

### Basic attacks

All of this consist of berserker auto attack animations and to save time ill call them by the direction they go.

**Up, Down, Spin Around, and Slam**
* All 4 hits are blockable

**Down, Down, Up, Knockback spin**
* The first hit staggers and the second hit of the spin at the end knocks you back, all blockable and shieldable.

### Special attacks 

#### 90% Closest/Furthest Debuff

The boss will stand up straight and say a message, either:

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The guys nearby... are annoying... ->  **targetting closest person**.<br>
Those guys back there... are infuriating... ->  **targetting furthest person**.
{{< /callout >}}
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/804308617703850014/804321286243221514/closest_furthest_debuff.png)
This will give a 45 second long ice debuff to closest or furthest depending on the message. <br>This will **slow you by 10%** for 90 seconds.
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/804308617703850014/804321421769179156/closest_furthest_2_stack.png)
This mechanic happens every **45 seconds** and if you take 2 in a row, you will be **frozen** and instantly die.
* Rotate between healer and a mobile dps. But why not tank and healer you ask? it interacts with a different mechanic.

{{< callout type="error" >}}
[HARD MODE] The furthest/closest mechanic will now target **2 people at a time**, need to alternate similar to RMHM.<br>
Try to avoid the tank taking it, as you dont want ice puddles being thrown at the tank **ever**.
{{< /callout >}}

<br>

#### Snowball Puddles

There is a **frost giant chained to the north wall** and he will **target** people specifically with the 45 second debuff.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/804308617703850014/804321286243221514/closest_furthest_debuff.png)

He will **spit a giant snowball** at them that will home in until it hits, creating a **puddle of ice** on that spot.
* Standing in an ice puddle and every single attack he does in unleash will apply a **frost stack**.<br>Reaching 10 stacks of this will freeze you solid, killing you.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/804308617703850014/804328500072677406/ice_stacks.png)

These puddles last a long time so placing them well matters for later.

#### 85% Stomp Mechanic

The boss will quickly put his axe over his right shoulder and rear back and stomp, knocking everyone down. 
* Kaia and iframe will dodge it, blocking doesnt work.

<br>

<center>
<video controls>
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/RoSgiVv.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

After the boss will do one of 3 different attacks, based on a glow he gets around certain parts of him.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Red Glow Around Axe** -> Giant thunderstrike<br>
**Blue Glow Around Pants** -> Giant Cyclone - Each tick of this cyclone gives a nasty bleed that stacks, 7% hp per tick per stack.<br>
**No Glow At All** -> Roll into strike on Random target
{{< /callout >}}

When you engage the boss at 100% he will have a buff for the entire fight:
<br>This makes him immune to stuns.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/804308617703850014/804323470368047114/immune_to_stun_buff.png)

The **instant the boss starts stomping**, he will lose this buff for 2 seconds, replaced by a buff that makes him **vulnerable to stuns**:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/804308617703850014/804323670129901599/stunnable.png)

If anyone can react to the stomp fast enough, **you can prevent both the stomp and the following attack** after.
* This mechanic has a **45 second cd** and very often lines up right after the **closest/furthest debuff**.

### HARD MODE ONLY

Starting from **100-95% the boss will gain a buff every 35-55 seconds** for the the entire fight:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/804308665606864916/804342197922824212/delayed_power_buff.png)

When this buff times out, it will give him a stack of increasing power. 
* This is **removable with plague/regression** as written in [Increasing Power](#increasing-power) in first section.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/804308665606864916/804342313597665280/2_damage_increase_over_time.png)
This is separate from gaining it over time starting at 70%.
* The result is he will have many more stacks over a short period of time, you can't stall hardmode forever with low dps.<br>
{{< callout type="error" >}}
There will be nothing left of you!
{{< /callout >}}<br>
Gaining 10 stacks of this buff causes the boss to shout the message above and **WIPE** the party.

**Ice Stacks** - From Snowball Puddles/Unleash.
* It now only takes 7 ice stacks to fully freeze your character.

**Range-Check + Wave**
* The boss will shout leap to the furthest player to him. The boss landing also knocks anyone near him down, spawning a wave coming out.
