## First Boss: Akalath Travan

### Key Mechanics

**Color Mechanic** - This mechanic is the same as in Ruinous Manor (Hard), oneshotting you if you fail or your debuff times out.
* Mechanic starts when the boss says :

      Bear my curse!

And draws his swords away from his body.<br>
Whenever he uses this mechanic, it will create a pulse of energy **debuff** on the players. Changing or giving them a new color if they have none.
* Pay attention to your debuff!

You will die after getting 2 stacks of the same color or the duration expires.

There are only two variations of this attack. Same as in Ruinous Manor (Hard).
* If the color thats being **gathered near boss** is blue -> Blue will be IN, Red OUT
* If the color thats being **gathered near boss** is red -> Red will be IN, Blue OUT

You can watch boss's feet for the color, or swords that he draws out. Both become colored by the color that will appear inside.
* **Always remember to take the opposite of the color that you have.**
* **HEALERS** Keep everyone healed up. When you are hit by new color, it will still hit you for significant amount of HP.

**Begone** - The boss will say : 

     Begone!

And puts his hands together gathering energy.
* Attack range of this mechanic is **20meters around the boss**.
* Keep your distance from Travan to avoid it. 
* Impossible to block, impossible to iframe.
  * You can skip running away from this mechanic will **lancers protection skills or healers kaia** skills.

Under 50% he will **follow up with a second scratch** on the right side.

**Right,Right,Back turn,Sword slam into Rear** - This attack is very dangerous if you are damaging the boss from the side. The rear hit will most likely oneshot you if you are low on HP.
* Make sure to **iframe the rear hit**. Sword hit on the back is easily avoidable.
* Dps who are attacking from behind and are very close to the boss will not take any damage.
  * If the aggro changes to be behind boss, the boss will do only **rear attack** behind him before turning.

**4 Scratches** - Boss gives out **secondary aggro** 4 times in a row to random players.
* Each time the boss will proceed to swipe in the direction of secondary aggro.
  * Best is to not move so much, so the boss doesnt turn to all sides and swipe everywhere.

**Circle AOE into Spin** - Most likely the **deadliest** attack apart for the color mechanic.
* The boss will create and aoe on the ground under every member of the party.
* When the AoEs stay on the ground, iframe. 
  * If you fail to iframe, you will be stunned. Stun is **cleansable**
* Right after the AoEs hit, boss will spin. Killing everyone in his near proximity if they are stunned.
  * Spin is unlockable (**blue shield can be used**), can be iframed.

Sometimes the boss can also only spin without doing AoE bombs. 
* You can see the spin coming as he puts his hands on the ground and "**stretches**" his hands out before spinning.
