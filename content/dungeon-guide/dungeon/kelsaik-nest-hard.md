In this area, you will have to defeat 5 protectors. <br>
Their classes are **Lancer**, **Slayer**, **Archer**, **Sorcerer**, and **Mystic**. 
* **The Slayer protector is the most difficult.** 
* Defeat each in order. When 3 are down, the last 2 will automatically attack your party at the same time.

**Kelsaik is 99% Crit Resistant.**<br>
The fight **starts off with one of two random moves**, these are usually a double rend followed by a Fire AoE, but it's not 100%. 
* The list includes:

**Roll**<br>
**Stun**<br>
**Small Jump**<br>
**Jump Back**<br>
**Trample into Tail Swipe** - Bleed effect<br>
**Fire / Ice AoE**<br>
**Fire Wall** - Activates fire dmg floor<br>
**180 degree Cleave Swipe** - Bleed effect<br>
**Double Rend**

## Boss: Kelsaik

### The Beginning; Phase One (100% to 75%)

Kelsaik has access to all attacks listed above; for this part just DPS him down as normal. 
* **DPS need to make sure they're paying attention and swapping out their debuffs.**

* The easiest way to do this is to stand behind the hind leg associated with the front paw of whichever element you need, and then whenever he does a double rend, the element of that paw will create a low damaging conic AoE that shoots behind him.

At random times during the fight, **he will purple circle (secondary target) random people.** 
* During this phase that is a sign that he will do one of two things: 
  1. If you get purple circled, **but not stunned**, he's going to run and roll at you. This is confirmed by him scratching at the ground with his hind-right left two times before the roll starts.
  2. If you get purple circled and **stunned**, that's a sign that he's going to use a deadly attack, confirmed by the on-screen prompt that says : 
   

         "Kelsaik recharges."
    

If this second one occurs, you need to use a **Torch of the Gods** (a order for this should be defined beforehand). 
* The torch removes Kelsaik's debuff immunity, at which point everyone needs to immediately attempt to stun him. 
* **Do not overstun him though**, as being stunned is always followed up with a double rend, which is the best way for people to change their Doomfire or Doomchill, and if he gets stunned out of this, he will skip it entirely. 
During this phase, while the torch is in effect, **stack on as many debuffs/shreds as you can**, because the window to do so is only 10 seconds long and then he will be immune to debuffs again.

If an on-screen prompts appears that says :

     "Kelsaik howls" 
     
This is a sign that **he's about to use an AoE roar**.
* At this time everyone wants to get close as they can, as the roar will stun anyone caught in it for about 8-9 seconds.

Finally, at random times he may spawn a barrier that places a buff on him called **"Armor of Doom"** and a debuff on everyone else called **Seal of Revenge**.

Armor of Doom is a **shield that needs to be burned down within 35 seconds**. 
* Failure to break the damage threshold within that time will give Kelsaik a 60 minute buff called **Rampancy** that will quadruple his attack power and speed, essentially meaning the run is a **wipe**.

Additionally **during the barrier phase**, there will also be one of two largely damaging **DoT debuffs placed on everyone that removes 20% of max HP per five seconds** and **decreases either ranged damage by 60% (Seal of Punishment)** or **melee damage by 60% (Seal of Revenge)**. 
* These seals **cannot be cleansed.**
* When the shield is broken, the barrier is removed and the seals are removed as well within 2-3 seconds. 
  * Seal of Punishment will always appear first; 
  * Seal of Revenge will appear if a second barrier is placed (caused by failing to reach the second phase within a set amount of time).

During all of the above remember to watch for his Fire and Ice AoEs, as these are his most deadly attacks.

### Persistent Pools; Phase Two (75% to 55%)</h4></center>

During this phase, in addition to everything listed above, **claw attacks will now leave persistent pools** on the ground associated with the element of the attack.
* Fire claw leaves a pool of fire
* Ice claw leaves a line of ice. 
  * These pools can be used to more easily switch your debuff, but anyone switching needs to be aware at all times that after a claw attack, Kelsaik can follow up with either his Fire or Ice AoEs.

Additionally during this phase, **the mechanic behind Kelsaik's roll is changed.**
* Following his roll, Kelsaik will either immediately do:
  1. A **short-range roar (that stuns)** and then turn and do a small jump
  2.Or he'll turn first, do a **long-range roar (that stuns)**, and then a **big jump**. 
* This big jump is further signified by the way he crouches down in preparation to jump, as well as a blue mist that appears around his mane.

If it's a **small jump**, DPS can move right back in as the small jump is not very damaging. <br>
If he does a **big jump**, whoever was targetted by the purple circle from the roll needs to get to the Lancer who will then use *Pledge of Protection* and put themselves between Kelsaik and whoever got targetted and use Stand Fast's defense to reduce the damage from the jump.
* Anyone who wasn't targeted by the roll should get away until the big jump is completed.
* Additionally, should the person who was targeted by the purple circle die between the time Kelsaik rolls and the time Kelsaik does his big jump, Kelsaik will still jump at that person, even if they're dead.

During this phase, everyone needs to be vocal; if you're rolled at (you get the purple circle), let people know. 
* If you're the Lancer, let people know when the fire and ice pools are coming so they're ready to refresh their debuffs.

### Death Field; Phase Three (55% to 45%)

**Pools from claw attacks are no longer persistent.**

This is going to be the first real hurdle as **this is a DPS race.** 

During this phase, Kelsaik puts a **barrier** around himself that absorbs a large amount of damage and inflicts everyone with a debuff called **Seal of Death**. 
* With this debuff in effect, **you lose 1% of your max HP every second**, and it is **impossible to heal**; nothing will heal you, not even potions.
* To get past this phase you need to **DPS him down as fast as possible to remove the barrier**. 
  * Once the barrier is removed (by doind a set amount of damage) and the Seal of Death is removed (takes about 2-3 seconds from the barrier being removed), the **healer** needs to heal everyone up.

**DPS does not stop though**, as once the barrier is removed **you have a 20-25 second window to get him below 45% or the pattern will repeat**. 
* It is highly advised to **go into this phase with a refreshed doomfire or doomchill**, and do not try to change in the middle the of barrier; only change during the downtime when the barrier has been broken, and remember that you need to **keep DPS up to prevent a second Seal of Death**.

**This phase does not occur in Normal Mode.**

### World Destroyer; Phase Four (45% to 0%)

At this point, an **eight-minute timer starts**.
* Kelsaik **must be killed within this time frame**, though truthfully this timer is **not as pressing** as it may seem. Just keep DPS up and dodge attacks while changing elements as needed.
* This is where the real fight begins, especially for your **healer**.

During this phase a new, persistent, **debuff is introduced called "Curse of Kelsaik"** this **debuff increases your power by x%, but at the same time removes y% of your max HP per five seconds**, and **can stack up to 99 times**.

* The **healer's role heal, in addition to healing, is to keep everyone cleansed of these stacks**
* They can be removed, but they keep coming back, so it's a constant affair. 
  * A few stacks isn't too deadly, but *once your reach 7 or more stacks*, you will want to get a **cleanse** as soon as possible.

**Breath Attack** - Additionally during this phase, **Kelsaik will walk to the center of the arena, drop a crystal/wardstone, and then walk and jump outside of the arena.** 
* He will follow this up with a **large flame wave that covers the entire arena**, dealing an extreme amount of damage which usually kills everyone. <br>

<center><video controls height="356" width="704">

</video></center>

At this time, everyone **needs to run and stand behind one of two indentations in the ground** near the center of the arena (whichever one the lancer moved to). 
* The lancer in your group then needs to **leash the crystal closer to everyone**. 
* Someone needs to be watching Kelsaik as he is outside the arena, and **right as he rears his head back is the best time to break the wardstone**. 

This will raise a shield from the indentation that will guard you from the incoming flame wave. 
* Remember that it is better to err on the side of early, rather than late in regards to this. 

**If for whatever reason you pass the eight-minute timer, Kelsaik will no longer drop a wardstone**, but will continue to jump out of the arena. 
* If this happens, your best chance to survive is to gather on your lancer who will use Guardian Shout, Pledge of Protection, and then **shield everyone with Stand Fast**.
  * They will likely die in the process, but this is a necessary sacrifice if Kelsaik is close to death.

Following the flame wave attack, Kelsaik will jump back into the arena and then **immediately do a double rend**, so if you need to change your elemental debuff, this is the best time.

At **5%**, **pools from claw attacks become persistent again** and **Kelsaik enrages**.

Nothing new is introduced at this point however, just keep up damage and you've got it.
