## First Boss: Guardian Kethro

First boss is extremely simple and seems incomplete honestly because the *"gimmick"* is entirely ignorable, even on HARD mode.

### Key Mechanics

**Black/White circles and in/out**

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
"You won't get out of this place." 
{{< /callout >}}

The boss will spit up 5 puddles in a circle around himself, either being black or white.
* If  you have a decently geared healer, you can kaia shield this and eat it, damage reduction also works here.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Black Puddles = go out 10m then in<br>
White Puddles = stay in then dash out
{{< /callout >}}

<br>

<center>
<table>
   <tbody>       
      <tr>
        <td>Black Puddles</td>
        <td>White Puddles</td>
      </tr>
      </tr>

             </video>
         </td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>
</center>

**20% Shield**

At 20% the boss will shield for 20 seconds and afk.<br>
* After breaking the shield, the boss will begin charging an attack but also become vulnerable to stuns.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Stun him to interrupt his attack.
{{< /callout >}}

### Special attacks 

**Baby lizards and Black spit**

Youll notice in the above clips the floor is covered in black circles and small lizards on the outside of the room.
* This mechanic is **ENTIRELY ignorable** and does nothing, even on hard mode.

### Basic attacks 

**1-2 Delayed Slap into Tail Thrash**

The boss will purposely **delay his second slap** on the tank with the right hand. This signals a tail attack is coming.

<br>

<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/OaeH6Ox.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**180 Spin into Frontal Breath**

Someone will get a **blue aggro circle** and the boss will target that person for this. The only thing you need to be **careful of is the breath**.

<br>

<table>
   <tbody>       
      <tr>  
         <td><video width="320" height="240" controls>

             </video>
         </td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>
</center>

**Dig into Stun**

The boss will target someone with a blue circle and burrow into the ground briefly.<br>
* When his tail finally goes under, that is when you get out or block if possible.
* If someone remains stunned they will be targeted with a frontal breath from above.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Watch blue circle and tail going under then leave.
{{< /callout >}}

## Second Boss: Rampaging Hellen


### Key Mechanics

#### Frost Debuff

This boss is all about hugging your healer so you stay warm and not dead from the cold.

| Icon | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| ![](https://i.imgur.com/9ZsRjN5.png) | Applied every 15 seconds from engaging the boss to everyone with 20 second duration.<br>This ticks for 10% of your max hp every tick. **If this stacks to 3 you will be frozen solid.**<br>Healers **cleanse often** when hp bars turn purple. |

#### 97-96% Big Spin
* 60 second cd

The crux of this entire fight.<br>
The boss will stand up straight in the EXACT same animation as the small spin. **This time the boss will do 2 extremely damaging spins determined by enrage.**

{{< callout type="error" >}}
If it is **NOT enraged** it will do Inner spin followed by Outer spin.
if it **IS enraged** it will do Outer spin then Inner spin. 
{{< /callout >}}

The range for the inner spin is 10m to be safe. Afterwords it will do **2 different pizza slices** which are also fatal.<br>
The pizza pattern is also determined by enrage.

<br>

<center>
<table>
   <tbody>       
      <tr>
        <td>Unenraged Version</td>
        <td>Enraged Version</td>

      <tr>
        <td><center>Out 10m - immediately go in - Right side of boss - Left side of boss.<br>

           IN - OUT - LEFT - RIGHT</center></td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>
</center>

It looks more scary than it really is, it can be broken down simply.
No matter your orientation to the boss the safe spots remain the same.

#### 85% Ice Shards
* 2 minute cd

The boss will put her mouth into the air and rain 3 ice shards on a random person.
* This cannot be avoided in any fashion and must be healed through.

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/1gMrArC.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

#### 85% Ice wave and Stun
* 2 minute 30 second cd

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
"If you scatter, you will die." 
{{< /callout >}}

The boss **will perma stun the furthest player from him**, shown by a red orb above their head while an ice wave slowly comes towards the boss.

The other **4 players must group on the person with the red orb**, also stunning themselves.
* Once all 5 players have it, the orb will turn blue and allow you to move over the ice wave unharmed and not stunned. 

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/6yQnkHr.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

If you do not have all 5 players alive and available for this mechanic, the person with the red orb has to take the L and die. Everyone else use a dash or move quickly through the ice wave and pray you survive.

Heres an example without all 5 people alive, resulting in everyone but the lancer getting stunned.

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/fBwTdKE.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

#### 76% Frontal and Back Waves

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Try to escape from it if you can! 
{{< /callout >}}

The boss will turn her "arms" towards her back and remain still in a unique animation.<br>
After some seconds the boss will spawn a giant wave, first in front, and then behind wherever it is facing.

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/ExSY2ps.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

You may notice 6 holes on the edges of the arena, these can be used to avoid it.
* Each hole will link with its opposite and teleport you like portals.

Here is how its done by outranging it.

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/m678GxL.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

#### 65% Submerge and Cage

The boss will spawn a blue message and burrow under ground.<br>
Its important to note the pattern on the floor, its your guide on range for this mechanic.

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
"A snowstorm always enshrouds the world in silence..."
{{< /callout >}}

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/924800284608319518/936514548389802044/1533.png?ex=658e6d23&is=657bf823&hm=371555a78ae61b080e6a5e316ef18ce96025b13ffd3d04d1e5d6fa1fd5886493&)
Standing **beyond the red outline/ border on the floor will save you** from pushback and frost debuff when the boss re-emerges.<br>

When the boss emerges again in the center, he will form a cage and you will be silenced for 90% of it, a really long time. That means no cleanse for frost stack either
* **Either dont get hit or bring potions.**

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/JcqUTG3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

The pizza pattern is actually entirely static based on boss position.
* **The boss keeps that position.**

![](https://i.imgur.com/tUnMwQc.png)

The boss will form a cage that you must be inside and then walk a pizza pattern while silenced.

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/x7n3Uk3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

#### 40% Green stones + debuffs

The boss will roar, giving every player in the group a number 1-5.
* **2 green stones will also spawn** somewhere randomly in the room.
* These will push you away if you go near them.

90 seconds after assigning everyone a number, the boss will burrow underground with a red message: 

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
I'll finish you off, one by one.
{{< /callout >}}

The boss will now charge directly at players in the order of the number debuffs, 1-5.<br>
The goal is to make her run into the green rocks to destroy them so you have more room.

### Special attacks 

**Small Spin**

The boss will stand up straight followed by a 10m spin around himself.<br>
* This will tick multiple times but the damage is ignoreable. The ticks of damage will knock you away unless you block or have some form of shield.

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/bFnKn6z.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

If someone does get knocked away, the boss likes to breath on them in an attempt to kill.

**Front Breath**

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/AhI3vL4.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

### Basic attacks 

**1-2 into Back Stab**

All blockable here, pay attention to the speed of the 1-2 punch on the tank, relevant for next.
* The twin backstab behind will likely kill. **Dps tend to afk on the side for this fight.**

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/DIVMEn6.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Fast 1-2 into Front Stab**

Same as above, only the 1-2 hit will happen with less time between hits, this lets you know its front instead.

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/B7y05wG.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

**Frontal Breaths**

The boss will breath on the tank in a certain direction, either from left to right, or right to left.<br>
The back rolls will stun for 6 seconds if hit but is removable.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Left to Right** = Breath - Back roll - Front stab<br>
**Right to Left** = Breath - Front roll - Back stab
{{< /callout >}}

<br>

<center>
<table>
   <tbody>       
      <tr>
        <td>Left to Right</td>
        <td>Right to Left</td>
      </tr>
      </tr>   
         <td><video width="320" height="240" controls>
              <source src="https://i.imgur.com/bT49sv0.mp4" type="video/mp4">

             </video>
         </td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>
</center>

**Belly Flops**

Similar to above. The boss will twin stab - belly flop - twin stab again.<br>
There are 2 possible patterns for this.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Frontal Stab** - Frontal Belly Flop - Back Stab<br>
**Back Stab** - Back Belly Flop - Frontal stab
{{< /callout >}}

You'll know immediately because this is the only situation where she twin stabs outright with nothing before it.
* Where she twin stabs is also where she will belly flop a second later.

Getting hit by the belly flop will send you high into the air **if not outright one shotting you**.

<br>

        <td>Front</td>

         </td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
</table>
</center>

</div>

### HARD MODE ONLY

There isnt alot different on hard mode, but what is there is substantial.

**Skeletons**

3 minutes into combat skeletons will appear with maces swinging on each of the portals on the outside of the room. 
* These will bonk you with their mace, preventing you from using the portals for a while.

![](https://i.imgur.com/gK7WWIP.png)

#### 50% Dakuryon
* 60 seconds cd

At 50.9%, a red message will appear saying:

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
"Shall I show you how to do it?"
{{< /callout >}}

In tradition with him being the original "pizza" man boss.
* He will shoot a red blast, splitting the room in 2.

You then have to physically look where he is in the room and watch his animation.

He will trigger a blast on either side of his pizza slicer, knocking anyone on that side far back. **This will happen twice in a row.**<br>
* This is preventable with rally cry and healer shield entirely.

While not dangerous on its own, it can line up with something REALLY nasty like cage for example when everyone is silenced, or the ice wave.

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/tdNM154.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

Pay **very close attention to dakuryon** if you can zoom out far enough for this mechanic.

He will trigger the **red slice and then teleport in a direction**. This direction tells you where he will hit.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
If he shifts to the **left** = he will blast the right
if he shifts to the **right** = he will blast the left
{{< /callout >}}

He always moves AWAY from the side hes gonna blast. Go the same direction he goes or be aligned with him. 

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/5lvAKaA.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

In the above clip you can see him teleport off screen to the left so he blasts right side. **Hes located in top left** if you have trouble seeing him at first.

#### 20% A Test of Wills

At 20% a bar will appear that is literally "Snakes will vs Dakuryons Will".<br> 
This will start at 0 and increase by 20 per person with green poison debuff.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/933062248358871040/936522378891124786/1530.png?ex=658e746e&is=657bff6e&hm=e5fae72bf045c4d984d21d0bd6241ca924641bb229c734b2bec6ff06a4af6f6d&)

<br>

{{< callout type="info" >}}
This debuff is applied from:
1. Standing in the green stones
2. Icicles falling on someone
3. Frontal breaths of any kind 
{{< /callout >}}

It can be decreased back to 0 by cleansing poison asap.

| Icon | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| ![](https://teralore.com/items/icon_items/fireworks_ding_question_tex.png) | Dakuryons Will increases the bosses damage by 50% and Attack Speed by 10%<br>The boss will receive Dakuryons Will once the bar increases from 0 the first time and remain. Hellens will wont apply unless the bar is nearly or totally full - never. |

<br>

<center>
<video controls height="246" width="604">
  <source src="https://i.imgur.com/FRuhjZf.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video></center>

Dakuryons Will being applied during a cage is devasting, as it **will increase the damage of the 5th unavoidable hit** and will certainly kill most if not all your group.
