## First Boss: Rokdos
### Key Mechanics

**Curse of Rokdos** - The boss will say “Who hungers for my curse?” and cast a curse on the two members closest to the boss every minute.
* Debuff ticks for 8% of your max HP every 2 seconds per stack, and puts a red circle above your head. The bleed lasts for 2 minutes, and stacks to 3. At 3 stacks, the player will die. 
* If a player dies, Rokdos will say **“My curse is inescapable!”** and cast another Curse.

     The boss will always do R.I.P donuts (Attack Pattern 6) after the Curse Debuff.
     
**Spiral Beam** - Every 20% (80% / 60% / 40% / 20%), the boss will move away and spawn pillars, announced by : 
    
{{< callout type="info" >}}
The living have no place here!      
{{< /callout >}}    

The boss will then do the Spiral Beam pattern, but you must break the pillars in time to give everyone a 3 second barrier to prevent a one-shot wipe.

   </tbody>
</table>
</center>     
     
     Lancer can use Chained Leash on boss to destroy all pillars at the same time.
     

### Basic attacks

**Double Swing** - Boss swings twice in a row towards the tank.<br>
**Triple Swing and Sweeping Slash** - Boss swings three times towards the tank, and then does a doublehanded charging sweep that hits twice.<br>
**Fan Slash** - The boss crosses his weapons, points at the target, and then deals damage in front of him as a cone.<br>
**Back Razor Slash** - Rokdos does a Double Swing starting with his left sword, then turns around and deals damage in a cone of 3 lines. 
* Can be avoided by standing in the right positions

### Special attacks

**Pounce** - Boss will pounce on target and **spin in a large AoE** regardless of whether someone was hit by the stun.

     This spin is not blockable.
     Cannot be iframed. Move away.
     
**R.I.P**           
* **Donuts:** The boss will announce **“This is where you die.”** before creating a donut either close- or mid-range from him.<br> 
If you get hit, you will get oneshot, and spawn a mini tombstone. Players near this tombstone will be feared.
* If the tombstone is not destroyed, the player will die.    

**Fear Blast** - This attack will push players back and can only be casted after a Pounce.

## Second Boss: Viyor
### Key Mechanics

**Extermination** - Once the boss reaches 80% health, he will start doing this attack every 1 minute 30 seconds. 
* The boss runs to the center and glows purple, before slamming the ground and releasing an energy wave that deals 150k damage. 
* To survive, **touch any one of the ghosts running around the edge** of the run for a 3 second buff that deals damage over time and prevents you from using abilities but renders you immune to this attack.
* Touching the ghost gives ‘Curse of the Spectre’ for the achievements ‘Ethereal Chills’ and ‘Touched by Darkness’
 
### Basic attacks

**Jump** - Deals damage in an AoE around the boss and will push players back.<br>
**Ghost Lines** - The ghosts on the edge will fire off lasers that deals damage.
* Be aware that this mechanic happens in sync with any mechanic Viyor is doing, so be careful.

### Special attacks

**Explosion Axe** - Viyor’s axe will glow as he raises it in the air, and the boss will randomly target a player and slam his axe in a large AoE on the ground. After a second, the axe will explode again, dealing damage and pushing players back. 
* Both hits are blockable (block towards the boss).
**Thunderclap** - The boss raises his axe, says 
     
 {{< callout type="info" >}}
Be gone!
{{< /callout >}}

* Pauses before swinging down and summoning thunder where everyone was. It has potential of oneshotting you. <br>
The damage is applied when Viyor’s axe slams into the ground, not after.

**Puddle** - Viyor will target the player furthest away and throw an AoE puddle towards that person. 
* Staying in this puddle will slow players and deal damage. This will disappear over time.

**Paralyze** - A modification of one of normal mode’s basic attacks, Viyor’s eyes will glint red and he will do a swing that will stun targets hit.<br>
**Ghost Bursters** - Ghosts will spawn **(announced by “A spirit rises!“)** and follow players until they catch up, at which point they burst and deal high damage.

## Third Boss: Desolarus
### Key Mechanics

* <h4>Rokdos’s Spectre</h4> 
After <strong>90% HP</strong>, Desolarus will become immune and summon Rokdos. <br>
It has the same attack patterns and mechanics except for the Spiral Beam Pillars. 

* <h4>Viyor’s Spectre</h4>
After <strong>50% HP</strong>, Desolarus will become immune and summon Viyor. <br>
It has the same attack patterns and mechanics except for Extermination.

     Thunderclap is warned by **“I will wipe you out!“**
     Hostile ghosts will attack random targets.

* <h4>Carpets</h4>     
After Viyor is defeated, Desolarus will use this mechanic every 90 seconds. <br>
Desolarus flies up into the air and there will be a very high amount of large one-shot carpets appearing randomly around the map.
* Good idea to stand in a cross intersection as this allows you to avoid these by simply walking. 
* This will last 30 seconds.

      Desolarus will usually cast a Clover after every Carpet.

### Basic attacks

**Spirit Bomb and Dybbuk Chests** - Occasionally, the boss targets a random pillar on the edge with a large Spirit Bomb. 
* When the bomb hits the pillar, it will release a very large carpet on the ground, **killing anyone** who remains in the area after a short delay.
* Players will need to look out for a distinct blue charging animation on the chair’s legs or for the red skull warning indicator on the boss’s health bar.

      Oneshot. Move away.

**3-line Vortex** - The boss releases lines of 3 attacks, first to left and right sides, and then front and back.
* Stay close to avoid it.

**3-line Release** - The boss release lines of 3 attacks, first front and back, and then to the left and right sides.
* Stay close, your tank can also block for you. 
 
### Special attacks

**Clover** - The boss releases two large attacks in a clover-shaped pattern. 

     Getting hit by both hits will kill you.

**Doom of Desolarus** - Once Rokdos is defeated, Desolarus will start casting his own Curse, warned by
    
{{< callout type="warning" >}}

* Players will need to alternate the Curse again.
* Using entities like thralls/totems also works.
 
**Desolarus’s Thunderclap** - Once Viyor is defeated, Desolarus will start casting his own Thunderclaps, warned by 

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
I will wipe you out!”
{{< /callout >}}
