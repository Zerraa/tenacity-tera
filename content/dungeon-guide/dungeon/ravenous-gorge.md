## Last Boss: Nimistrix

You may want to keep the boss away from the eggs to see the mechanics at first. Once you get used to them, it doesn’t matter as much.

### Key Mechanics

**Adament Plumage** - You’ll be notified with a message: 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Nimistrix’s skin is empowered!
{{< /callout >}} 

Your healer will need to cleanse this buff. 
* This defensive buff stacks. 

**Growing Egg** - You’ll be notified with the message that : 

{{< callout type="error" >}}
Nimistrix cries out! 
{{< /callout >}}

* One of the three eggs found in the bottom of the nest begin to grow to aid their mother, **your party must destroy the egg** as soon as possible, if you do not destroy the egg, three chicks will appear and attack you. 
  * You can kill the chicks, but this is a much harder task than DPSing the egg. 
  * Also, failure to destroy the egg will result in a debuff that will reduce your speed and remove HP.

**Whirlwind** - You’ll be notified with the message: 

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
Nimistrix calls a storm!” 
{{< /callout >}}

* This is a wipe mechanic which inflicts damage on the whole playing field, except from a few circular areas which will spawn. 
  * These are noticeable by the outline of the circle. You must stand inside to avoid being hit.
  
**After 10 minutes, Nimistrix will enrage up to 3 times due to the destruction of her eggs**, he will receive a damage buff which will more or less cause any attack to 1 shot a player.

{{< callout type="info" >}}

{{< /callout >}} 

Your party has just few seconds to **interrupt Nimitrix, using a stun attack**, otherwise it will gain a 10 minute duration of a major power bonus.
