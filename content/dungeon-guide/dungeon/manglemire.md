## Boss: Manglemore
### Key Mechanics

### Manglemore's Mechanics

**Tricks** - The trick to fighting Manglemore is figuring out when he is lying. As the NPCs around the dungeon suggest, the key lies in **paying careful attention to the buffs** Manglemore gets.

* Keep an eye out for these buffs. These buffs can be in any combination, such as 6-9 or 3-6-9. These buffs also give Manglemore a 5% endurance buff each. 
  * Manglemore will start getting these buffs from 90% HP and on after saying :

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Might as well be honest… I’m lying from now on!”
{{< /callout >}}     
Once you notice these buffs, you will want to keep a close eye on the Manglemore’s Change of Heart bar.

* This Change of Heart gauge bar will increase from 0 to 100 by **1 point per second**.

**Let’s see you dodge this!** - Once the Change of Heart bar reaches 100, Manglemore will run towards the center of the room and circles will spawn around the boss. However, only 5 of the circles will have a star symbol inside, while the other 4 circles will be blue and turn anyone inside into a Snowman. 
* Each person much stand on a separate star circle (cannot stack) for the party to succeed this mechanics. 
  * Once this mechanic finishes, the Change of Heart bar goes back down to 0.

1. **SUCCESS**
Manglemore will say “You think you got skills? Let’s see how you do without the number (3, 6, or 9)!” <br>
If all 5 members succeed in standing in a star circle, one of Manglemore’s buff will be removed (the order the buff gets removed is: 3, 6, and then 9). 
  * Each time you succeed at this mechanic, one buff will be removed. For every success, the party receives a power buff (stackable) and the boss loses any buffs it may have received from failing earlier.
2. **FAIL**
Manglemore will say “You didn’t see that coming?! How disappointing!” <br>
If not all 5 members are standing in a star circle, your party will fail and anyone not inside a star circle will be turned into a Snowman. 
  * Manglemore will receive all his number buffs again, as well as gain a power and attack speed buff.

**Snowman debuff** - The Snowman debuff turns the player into a snowman with an AoE circle around them. 
* The debuff causes heavy bleeding. The Snowman debuff is contagious and will spread to other players if close enough.

### Special attacks

Before every Special Attack Patterns, he will always say “Arghhh! You forced me to do this!”

 {{< callout type="info" >}}
I will kill you all!
{{< /callout >}}   

- **TRUTH** : Stay **outside** the AoE circle to live.
- **LIE** : Stay **inside** the AoE circle to live.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
My shield will save me!
{{< /callout >}}
- **TRUTH** : Break the shield in time. Failing to break will reduce the party’s HP to 1, leash everyone and do a jump attack. The party will also receive a 7 second debuff preventing any sort of HP recovery.
- **LIE** : An AoE puddle will be placed below every player (lasts ~1 minute), so the party should move to the edge of the room to place the puddles. Getting hit by this puddle will inflict a bleed debuff (cleansable).

 {{< callout type="info" >}}
One of you must die!
{{< /callout >}}

- **TRUTH** : Stay **outside** the AoE circle that forms around one person to live. Use a movement or iframe skill to prevent getting hit by the circle. Targetted will die if the circle is not iframed.
- **LIE** : Stay **inside** the AoE circle the forms around one person in order to live.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
No! I don’t care anymore!
{{< /callout >}}

- In the middle of any of the above attacks, Manglemire may call the attack off randomly.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Ha! One of you is a Traitor!
{{< /callout >}}

[Triggers below 60% HP, every 2 minutes]
* The party will have a bomb shown above their head, and one person will get a balloon above their head and be stunned for the entire duration of this mechanic.
* One person will be the **Carrier** for a real bomb. The party (minus the **Balloon Holder**) must attack the boss in order for the fake bombs to disappear. The **Bomb Carrier** needs to stay far away from the **Balloon Holder** and the rest of the party.

The party (except the Bomb Carrier) need to take the circle with the Balloon Holder (similar to a Kalivan’s Dreadnaught mechanic) to help absorb the flat 250,000 damage. 
* The more (non-invincible) bodies inside the circle, the less damage will be taken per person.
  * Anyone hit by the Balloon circle will be inflicted with a Bleed debuff, so healers should be prepared to cleanse.
  
## If the Balloon Holder is a Carrier
