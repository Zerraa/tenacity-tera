## Second Boss: Magnarox
### Key Mechanics

**Godbinder** - This fight involves co-operation. Your team will need to split into 2 groups as this fight involves 2 battles. One team will be fighting the boss and the other team will be protecting the Godbinder (the big sword) from a group of monsters. 
* **The aim is to kill the boss before the mobs destroy the Godbinder.**

* The raid must decide on who goes where, as the room will be split and divided after 30 seconds of starting the fight. **A gate will spawn between the boss and the mobs/Godbinder, so act quickly.** 
  * A Priest can pull players, however. **The gate will disappear for a set duration at 80%, 60%, 40% and 20% of the bosses HP.**
* **If the Godbinder is damaged, then the boss will receive a beneficial boost.**

* **Slides** (boss will **slide against the ground**, causing damage and leaving behind an eruption)

* **Spin** (the boss will spin and move around causing deadly damage to anyone close enough).

## Third Boss: Sammar-Sammal

This boss is usually kept in the middle, due to AoE’s around it.

### Key Mechanics

**Energy Overload** - During the fight, energy will rain down onto the field.
* **You must dodge all the red danger zones to avoid being hit.**
  * If hit, you’ll receive a fixed amount of damage, this may not kill you, but taking too many, or if your HP is too low, you will die.

### Basic attacks

**Snake Attacks** -  Sammar’s regular attacks will consist of it using it’s snakes. These are frontal damage attacks, it may use more than one to attack.
* Similar to other hydraths, it may combo it’s snake attacks and deal more consistent and heavier attacks, be careful.

### Special attacks

**Shock Wave** - During the fight, Sammar will rotate it’s body vertically (it’s bottom half will be on top), this indicates it’s next move, a shock wave. 
* The area around Sammar will be jolted with waves of energy, causing stagger and several tickers of damage to those who are caught.

**Inverted Energy** - 30 seconds after the fight has begun, Sommar will wrap it’s snakes around itself, before releasing them and a veil of inverted energy.

## Final Boss: Duras

He will move around, like Fulminar from Bathysmal Rise, you may have to use similar tanking methods.

### Key Mechanics

**Melted Armor** - Duras’s arm **glow orange** and he will strike. Players hit by this powerful punch will receive a harmful effect. 
* **Players’ weapon defense (block amount) will be reduced.** This will occur after the second Stomp. 
  * If tanks receive three stacks of Melted Armor, blocking attacks will heavily drain Resolve.

**Pyrovores** - Throughout the battle, these pyrovores will spawn announced by : 
     
{{< callout type="info" >}}
Pyrovores are approaching”
{{< /callout >}}
* **They should be killed as soon as possible.** 
* If they make their way to the vents, they’ll receive an increase in defense, making them hard to kill. This becomes an issue as they occupy the vent spots, which are needed in the next mechanic:

**Lava Flow** - When Duras is reaches: 80%, 60%, 40% and 20% HP, he’ll make his way to the centre of the field and plunge into the ground to unleash a wave of lava that spreads throughout the entire area. This is notified by :

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Burn for me!”
{{< /callout >}}
* To survive this attack, you must make your way to one of the vents located on the outer edges. Standing on them will push you into the air, saving you from burning. 
* **Be aware, there is a limit for the amount of players per vent (3).**

**Akeron's Power** - When Akeron shouts “Duras, I give you the gift of fire!“, Duras will be given an aura which deals damage over time to everyone within 20m. 
* If your heals are good and the party is evading damage as normal, you can heal through this. 
  * If you feel like you’re going to die, then you may exit the 20m zone.

**Circle of Fire** - When Duras shouts : 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
You will all burn!”
{{< /callout >}}

* Duras will stomp the ground, sparking a fiery blaze of damage. **This is static damage.**

**Aura of Fire** - When Duras shouts 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
The whole world will burn!”
{{< /callout >}}

* Duras will stomp the ground. **He will gain an aura similar to Akeron’s Power, dealing damage over time to players nearby.** There is no visual indicator for the area though.

**Duras’s Barrier** - Akeron will command 

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Duras! Focus on (Player)!” 
{{< /callout >}}

He will have a shield which will need to be destroyed by dealing damage. 
* However, Duras will focus on a player and attempt to stomp them to death with flat damage stomps whilst the shield is active. **You cannot use iframes if you are the targetted player.** It is recommended that healers constantly heal the player and the priest can use their pull if needed. 
  * The targeted player can constantly circle around Duras’s legs to avoid damage while the other party members attempt to destroy the shield.

* Players must watch out for the damage indicators to evade damage.

**Whip and Laser** - Duras will lock onto a random player and proceed to lash them out with a stone whip.
