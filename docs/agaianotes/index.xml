        &lt;h1&gt;Gear&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players who remember the Stormcry or Heroic Oath era of gear progression will find our gear path structure to be quite familiar. While our gearing may be based in principle on this era of gearing, we&amp;rsquo;ve combined it with some of the stats players will need to take advantage of skill passives available in this patch. We think that this kind of gearing is a lot healthier than the types of gear progression you&amp;rsquo;d normally find from this era of the game, both on retail and what you might find from other servers. Gone are random rolls and infusions &amp;mdash; instead, we&amp;rsquo;re putting a more singular focus in all aspects of the game to allow players greater freedom and flexibility in tailoring their character to fit their own wants and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All tiers of gear will be enchantable to a maximum of +9, before being able to be directly upgraded to the next tier of gear available. Players can expect to see the return of Item XP on gear, which should give you some extra flexibility in deciding how and when to enchant your gear. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry though, as that&amp;rsquo;s the only amount of RNG you can expect from our gearing; we&amp;rsquo;re not bringing back infusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 3% enchantment correction is applied on failure for all levels of enchantment across all tiers of gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly, we will have three tiers of gear equipment available on launch, corresponding to the tiers of dungeons we have made available on launch. Here&amp;rsquo;s what you can expect the gearing to look like on launch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tier 1: Forgotten&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcQLcRlPQtlvEkJ43pWPjojAd1VF6wKe99RXP4pqKlyqeX56g93AfDuqi0xDciVOg2n_xZDJMjzNTvCuKI8AP2PTHxweHAH3swTRhRiIEAcP5tzZu7QW8gkLREyxLpiXjQrhBdRUQ?key=PetMZDiB7HbhiqdAdVAUDg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is the first set of gear available to players upon reaching level 70. Accessories start at a tier lower than their equipment counterpart, so if this is Tier 1 gear, then these Faded accessories are Tier 0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we are using the Heroic Oath era of gear progression as a baseline, we&amp;rsquo;ve started to reintroduce selectable lines on certain pieces of equipment. Currently, we&amp;rsquo;re using a mix of some older lines and some of the newer lines that a lot of players have come to expect. Most notably, we&amp;rsquo;re giving players the opportunity to decide if they want to use &amp;ldquo;Enrage&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Cooldown Reduction&amp;rdquo; toplines. We&amp;rsquo;re also utilizing some of the newer versions of gear lines to aid players in tailoring the specific ratio of stats they&amp;rsquo;d like to use (for certain skill passives, for example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfW4facRYzcP8xkA8rph328WDziDeqyaNBe00xrHnklgzEWgmimTM9h574hJIXfwcExptNfR_-iB2LV4UdjKs9S6V-zGz8lfzCc_bjMQgKlCxR0HxSWHJ_XW0Self5970Ow3gaSGA?key=PetMZDiB7HbhiqdAdVAUDg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfduqf-Xtw5KDYGWR3Ei64enI574i0aEoFKyyrkIhbR_hO_t4MqQuKxfLNVB0WYJvhFnjkTnLNEDkpD9TZNpNCtXMz1iDBRtsIwj6WUltnmMen4S6wrpffnJzkOEq74m2lobTxPjA?key=PetMZDiB7HbhiqdAdVAUDg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;|&lt;br&gt;
Forgotten gear is going to be what players will use in the Tier 0 and Tier 1 dungeons. This gear will start with a basic success rate of 50% for each enchantment level. The Faded accessories players receive at the start will have a fixed 100% success rate to upgrade into Forgotten accessories, but starting with Forgotten, accessories will also require Item XP in order to maximize your success rate of upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgotten gear can be upgraded to Awakened gear starting at +9 enchantment level, with a basic success rate of 50%.&lt;br&gt;
Players can participate in a variety of content to obtain materials used for upgrading this gear, ranging from PvE dungeon content, solo Ace dungeons, Guardian Legion missions, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tier 2: Awakened&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe4dk0nPNlcNNtLEbtQPhbZay0zpmEtIMIeNtHn8gDa1OQA_cQiMA2cKw6_1h2SRzt77P9eXH49P2h8Hv0RK9i3dYNmrCu9gICV6IC49_ZMQItYP3Q6wOjMAPNzSaxWPdO5l6tlPg?key=PetMZDiB7HbhiqdAdVAUDg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gear set upgrades directly from the Tier 1 gear. Awakened gear is recommended to be used in the corresponding Tier 2 dungeon content. Not only does this equipment provide better stats than its Tier 1 counterpart, weapons will also start having an additional line of selectable stats available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awakened gear starts with a basic success rate of 30%, with -2% basic success rate subtracted for every 2nd enchantment level afterwards, with a minimum success rate of 22%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awakened gear can be upgraded to Elder&amp;rsquo;s gear starting at +9 enchantment level, with a basic upgrade success rate of 22%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tier 3: Elder&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeZvh33rhh4pu35Kxo8L2XYAfEAmsxraHx1XoolOplEwtRINRQhEkPYwLD9i3EqfILJxv1AgdMsXDoDFEO0tVH-9nGzPf759kKeX9vI695jNRVhyNa0YzdMlD93UwagAazzUf9U3Q?key=PetMZDiB7HbhiqdAdVAUDg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elder&amp;rsquo;s gear is the third and final gear set currently available for players, upgraded from Awakened gear. Elder&amp;rsquo;s gear is what players will be using to tackle Tier 3 dungeon content, the most challenging currently available on the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elder&amp;rsquo;s gear starts with a basic success rate of 25%, with -2% basic success rate subtracted for every enchantment level afterwards, with a minimum success rate of 12%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeQG1PR9ILQFJWBR2CbiEJwB_v6QhCDvo8XDBsUU_MeGflzMZTz6LML5ZG5ESgq5HfOfdq88xZaVhorGkS5jMDwTdW-iXaTBJ3c7WbEnZuLqpIxh5UFuxos2hABRphou0p768mKRw?key=PetMZDiB7HbhiqdAdVAUDg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeJTNtC5B2eiU5J9kyBPT52YA207eVubZFeZNt9PrxsIE6Db76VqWBiGR09rwY6w_eOA_8MIrCj9ClRUMMbXUvSbIkt3BhzxU2QWc0AagXmUjaxSah8WCLnfQ73oqMiaO3tTyIf?key=PetMZDiB7HbhiqdAdVAUDg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious about what these Augment sockets are for? Head over to the Talisman section here to learn more: &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1byySXNU2_nbPkiYNzNn5cwe7fnbRgOzgbkzLXjS8HM8/edit?tab=t.vwsoa94keou5#heading=h.uj2bdsjaq36&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Agaia Launch Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Etchings&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players will probably notice the lack of etchings on equipment. This is because we aren&amp;rsquo;t totally satisfied with Etchings as a system and we&amp;rsquo;d like to breathe new life into it, so we&amp;rsquo;ve gone ahead and disabled etchings for the time being until we&amp;rsquo;re happy with a better implementation. For now, players can enjoy the benefits of double Energetic IV weapon and glove etchings built directly into their gear&amp;rsquo;s stats, so they won&amp;rsquo;t have to miss out on performing their rotations as fluidly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Skill Advancements&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;All players will receive a box upon character creation filled with all of the necessary items to level up and unlock all of your Skill Advancements freely. We don&amp;rsquo;t believe that the retail grind of unlocking Skill Advancements is currently in the best interests of our players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeFEWRDE795v-yQbuQs_rGhES45TOPmQb7Lu6T7D0ojv55Kv0GDmt9jvr7C655uue0kJAZZj41uwClcnggYFmYwTF8zGNiuOTaCRXrRYN7VHiT9hoBZDM1dZvb5jKKepdvAV4O2Gg?key=PetMZDiB7HbhiqdAdVAUDg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Glyphs&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon use of the Level 70 Scroll, players will instantly unlock all of the available skills and glyphs for their class, including those obtained through Awakening. No more being forced to do the Awakening questline either, because you will receive an item upon character creation that awards the 5 extra glyph points. Players can immediately jump right in to the high octane combat that is all so familiar to them, without any of the prerequisite tedium of grinding first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdJUP3T1pMmdR9SsD6q_81FBkVshprA_sVgtJeZgmj0Z7qADIH2s6nvPqzbVWF1nQOkmOmre8FtoIYw3ofpPUnJ-RhYt9H6QciH0yCGXX6k_WJhr1If2dW56j3zPTzka-B0iQX4MQ?key=PetMZDiB7HbhiqdAdVAUDg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Enhancement Points&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t currently believe that the retail way of grinding EP from scratch was very healthy for players, so all players will instantly receive all 500 Enhancement Points needed to take all of their required perks, right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Card Collection&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The card collection system will not be utilized on launch. We think that the current retail implementation of cards is toxic to players and feel that it&amp;rsquo;s best left alone until we can decide what to do with this system later down the line to create a healthier and more enjoyable experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Dragons&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Players can earn the dragon mounts that provide the Crit Power buffs simply by participating in PvE dungeon content. Vanguard Requests reward the player with Dragonwing Scales, which can be used to purchase Dragon Scrolls, which have a small chance of rewarding a mount skill book directly, or guarantee a mount after collecting 40. Currently, only the &amp;ldquo;1.5&amp;rdquo; mounts are available to earn, and we&amp;rsquo;re weighing our options and considering the best places to implement the special &amp;ldquo;2.0&amp;rdquo; mounts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Dragon procs&amp;rdquo; have been reverted to the retail system, with a random chance to activate on successful attacks to monsters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Gathering &amp;amp; Crafting&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;We aren&amp;rsquo;t satisfied with how neglected these two systems are in the current state of the game, so we have big plans to completely revamp and overhaul how these systems are integrated into the game in the future. Some of these ideas were too grand to fit in time for launch, but players can expect to see big things on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, crafting will mostly be utilized for purposes such as crafting some materials needed for enchanting and upgrading your gear, and for things like crafting optional consumables to use for combat. We understand that some players may not feel like participating in these areas of the game, so we&amp;rsquo;ve made sure to make these kinds of items obtained through crafting fully tradeable, so you&amp;rsquo;ll never feel locked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;================&lt;/p&gt;
