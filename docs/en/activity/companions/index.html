Reputation levels and points Reputation is very similar to experience.
Reputation is divided into a number of different levels for which players must earn reputation points to progress through. Higher reputation levels generally require more points than the previous level to progress. Reputation points, just like experience points, are gained through quests and killing various mobs.

From v81 with the addition of Partners and onward, both are accessed from the Companion UI.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pets that have special Abilities can perform tedious tasks such as looting drop items, looting gold, gathering resources, or providing extra storage.</li>

<p>Pets can grow and level up by feeding them a big variety of items including Talents, Feedstock, Gear and various food items among many others. Once a Pet grows to Level 10, it can use an <strong>Evolution Core</strong> to evolve into a random Partner.</p>
<ul>
<li>Two Pets can also be combined to become a random Pet, or even a random Partner at a low chance. The higher the grades of the Pets, the more likely it is for the two to be combined into a Partner.
Note that combining two Grade 10 Pets is guaranteed to yield a random Partner.</li>
<li>Evolving or Combining Pets will lose their Pet Skills. Probability of obtaining a Partner of a certain rarity has been modified in v104.01.02 patch notes, leaning towards higher rarity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Partners are specialized Companions. What makes Partners most valuable is their <strong>Bond Skill</strong>, which provides valuable combat support. Partners also have one random passive skill called <strong>Gifted Skill</strong> that can be triggered randomly depending on how much Stamina the Partner has.
Partners can Train to take and learn Pet Skills from different Companions, so make sure to take Pet Skills from Pets before Evolving or Combining Pets.</p>
<p>Partners start at Grade 1 and Fellowship 1 and can be Promoted by consuming another Partner. <strong>Promoting a Partner increases its Grade by 1, and improves Fellowship by a random value.</strong> Partners cannot go past Grade 10, and therefore can only be promoted 9 times.</p>
<p>At level 66, you can get your first Partner from Hatching a Partner quest given by Loomey the Wanderering Scholar in Highwatch. While the obtained Partner does not gain more Fellowship from being Promoted, it can be used to promote another Partner.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="fellowship">Fellowship</h3>
<p><strong>Fellowship is what determines how effective your Partner&rsquo;s Bond Skill is</strong>. By promoting your Partner, Fellowship of your Partner will increase. While Fellowship caps at 50, the amount of Fellowship increased at each Promotion varies depending on the Grade of the sacrificed Partner.</p>

<p>While dependent on RNG, it is highly recommended to Promote a Partner <strong>sacrificing Grade 8 or higher</strong> Partners in order to maximize the potential Fellowship gain. Promoting a Partner with Grade 8 Partners guarantee 46 Fellowship.</p>
<p>For an uncommon Partner, 39 Fellowship is the minimum to maintain Bond Skill indefinitely, whereas for Rare and Superior Partner, 37 and 35 Fellowship is the minimum, respectively.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="bond-skill--power">Bond Skill : Power</h3>
<p>Select Partners can <strong>provide Power for their Bond Skill</strong>. Depending on the rarity of your Partner and how high the Partner&rsquo;s Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies. <br>
Four Partners - <strong>Marie, Kuncun, Cocomin, and Loo</strong> - have been released to have Bracing Force as their Bond Skill, which increases Power for a set duration of time.</p>

<p>Select Partners can <strong>provide Amplification for their Bond Skill</strong>. Depending on the rarity of your Partner and how high the Partner&rsquo;s Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies. <br>
Two Partners - <strong>Rico and Eco</strong> - have been released to have Robust Energy and Vibrant Energy as their Bond Skill, which increases Physical Amplification and Magical Amplication (respectively) for a set duration of time.</p>

<p>Special Superior Partners have been added to the game, <strong>providing Eternal Force for their Bond Skill</strong>. Depending on how high the Partner&rsquo;s Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies.
Three Partners - <strong>RK-9, Kalligar and Lumikan</strong> - have been released to have Eternal Force as their Bond Skill, which increases Power for a set duration of time.
Unlike Bracing Force, Eternal Force persists through death, meaning the <strong>Bond Skill does not expire upon death.</strong></p>
<p>Please refer to Bracing Force table for the obtained Power and its duration for these Special Partners.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 id="gifted-skill">Gifted Skill</h3>
<p><strong>Each Partner species is restricted to a set of Gifted Skills.</strong></p>
<p>A Gifted Skill Change Voucher is needed in order to change a Partner&rsquo;s Gifted Skill. The said item can be purchased with Mystery Market Coins from wandering Mystery Merchants randomly appearing in Val Oriyn, Northern Arun.</p>
