Lag Issues Similar to Nexus or Dreamstorm, large number of players concentrated in a small area exposed the 32bit client&rsquo;s inability to handle the overload of network packets and graphically rendering actions of over a hundred players, leading to client freezing until the surge of information decreased or disconnecting from the server.

The maps have a duration of 3 hours from the time of their pickup so you should keep an eye on your inventory for maps. They cannot be traded but they can be stored in a guild bank and other people with guild bank access can take them out.

Reputation levels and points Reputation is very similar to experience.
Reputation is divided into a number of different levels for which players must earn reputation points to progress through. Higher reputation levels generally require more points than the previous level to progress. Reputation points, just like experience points, are gained through quests and killing various mobs.

<p>Civil Unrest occasionally called Guild Wars is weekly PvP event which happens every Sunday.</p>
<pre><code>Restrictions: Level 11 and higher.
Time: Every Sunday from --- (time varies on pserver)
         original retail opened at 15:00 and started at 17:00
</code></pre>
<p>Before the start of Civil Unrest the Guild Master needs to buy a Guild Tower Blueprint from the [NPC: Amvya] in front of the Velika Federation Headquarters in Velika for Guild Coins. <br>
Guild Tower Blueprint can also be purchased from NPC in other major cities : <br></p>
<ul>
<li>Allemantheia City with NPC: Jarkek</li>
<li>Kaiator City with NPC: Frarang</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/pESoVKa.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To join the battle, players need to talk to [<strong>NPC: Brahem</strong>] who is a GvG Guide in Velika City - walk from the Ring teleport point forward and you will see him right on the right side near some bushes and a Skycastle model in front of him.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RxeEvUR.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To enter and build a tower you a guild need to complete <strong>weekly guild quest</strong> to get enough Valderon tokens.Depending on the Guild size, the amount of Valderon tokens will change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Small guild -&gt; needs <strong>700</strong> from 900 max</li>
<li>Medium guild -&gt; needs <strong>1100</strong> from 1300 max</li>
<li>Large guild -&gt; needs <strong>1500</strong> from 1700 max</li>
</ul>
<p>Character who builds the tower needs correct <strong>permission</strong> or be a <em>guild master</em>. <br>
Guild also needs to have least 5 members with character&rsquo;s level over 65 online and inside CU when it starts or guild tower auto-destructs when event starts and they won&rsquo;t get reward.</p>
<p>To win the CU guild must defend their tower and destroy other guilds&rsquo; towers.  <br>
Score depends on <strong>tower and player kills</strong>.If you happen to die in the war zone, you can respawn near your guild’s tower, or the in starting area (if tower is destroyed).</p>
<p>Winners get honour and glory, also <strong>Tanner lion</strong> mount for one week (speed 280, but useable in CU area too). <strong>Top 3 guilds get golden, silver and bronze lining</strong> on their guild icon on title.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/9zi40d3.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>While in the Civil Unrest area, weapon skins and other costumes cannot be used and every player will wear an unified costume.</strong> This is to improve the game performance so you dont need to worry about it too much.</p>

<h3 id="essentials">Essentials</h3>
</center>
<p>Before the actual start of Civil Unrest you would prefer to stack on needed potions which you can buy from <strong>Smuggler</strong> inside of the area. You can also buy <strong>Painkillers</strong> from him which are very useful in bigger battles that you will face! In addition, there are items such as <strong>Poison</strong> which when used will kill your character immediately (as they deal 1.000.000 flat damage).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UQjfJcE.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Its recommended to always have some Poison on you, as it makes regrouping much easier. If the respawn point is too far, running back can take a long time - therefore it is recommended to use poison to kill yourself and <strong>to return to Dock (Civil Unrest enterance)</strong> or choose to go back <strong>to the Guild Tower</strong> location.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UXDpfKB.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You will also need a <strong>different mount</strong>, which you can buy from Merchant in any major city. Winners of previous Civil Unrest can also use their <strong>Tanner</strong> mount, which can be ridden inside of Civil Unrest and is generally faster than a basic horse mount.</p>
