Lag Issues Similar to Nexus or Dreamstorm, large number of players concentrated in a small area exposed the 32bit client&rsquo;s inability to handle the overload of network packets and graphically rendering actions of over a hundred players, leading to client freezing until the surge of information decreased or disconnecting from the server.

<h2 id="gaining-reputation">Gaining reputation</h2>
</center>
<p>You get reputation by completing non-repeatable quests will usually increase your reputation with the quest giver&rsquo;s faction(s) by a fixed number of points. Most of the factions also have special daily quests that give reputation when completed, or special mobs that give reputation when killed.</p>
<p>For higher-end factions, a general strategy exists to make a reputation <strong>grind</strong> as painless as possible. <strong>Take the Valsekyr Hunt for example.</strong> There are several ways in which to earn reputation for them: doing standard quests, killing mobs in and around Argonea and Granarkus, killing BAMs, and <strong>doing daily quests</strong>.</p>
