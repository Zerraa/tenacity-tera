<p><strong>DPS</strong> - A large majority of the mobs in this dungeon cannot be stunned or slept, and can only be slowed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since they will be making a beeline for the crystals in the center of each platform, <strong>you&rsquo;ll need to delay them for as long as possible</strong> so that you have time to kill them. DPS should consider glyphing any skills that slow the opponent down with increased duration, increased slowing effect, and/or decreased cooldown if possible.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll want constantly use these skills during your standard damage rotation during the first and second platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TANK</strong> - <strong>Glyph for anything and everything that helps with aggro</strong>; you&rsquo;re gonna need all the aggro you can get for the second and third platforms.</p>
<ul>
<li>Extra points not spent on your tanking glyphs should go towards damage, since it helps with aggro and you&rsquo;ll want to contribute damage whenever possible.
<ul>
<li>Like DPS, you should also glyph your endurance reduction skills.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HEALER</strong> - Your primary job for a large part of this dungeon will not involve healing, since many of the mobs and BAMs you&rsquo;re going to kill will only target the center crystals anyway.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead, you should <strong>glyph your knockdown and CC</strong> (crowd control) skills with reduced cooldown and anything else that may help out, as you&rsquo;ll be going after bomb jockeys and keeping teraliths in perma-knockdown.
<ul>
<li>In other words, glyph your sleeps, stuns, slows, and knockdown skills (see below) for decreased cooldowns and increased effect durations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="entering-the-dungeon">Entering the dungeon</h4>
</center>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve prepared yourself, you can enter this dungeon either via instance matching or by forming a party.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xAbEHOn.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the dungeon isn&rsquo;t available in instance matching, it means that you haven&rsquo;t completed the questline for it yet. <br>
Upon reaching <strong>level 60</strong>, you should have received a questline which is started by talking to Fraya in Allemantheia Headquarters <em>(A Letter from Fraya)</em>.</p>
<p>The first quest in the chain <em>(Search for Research)</em> has you enter Malachai&rsquo;s Lab to go open a couple of boxes, while the next <em>(Ominous Traces)</em> has you reenter the same room to kill an imitation BAM. <br>
After finishing those two, Sirjuka Gallery will be unlocked and you can complete the final leg of the questline, &ldquo;A Tour of the Gallery&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/BozZQjy.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Upon entering the dungeon you&rsquo;ll see four platforms ahead of you on your minimap. The first platform closest to you is just for this dungeon&rsquo;s quest line if you need to finish it. All of the action will be taking place on the next <strong>three platforms</strong>, which we&rsquo;re going to designate as platforms 1, 2, and 3 from now on.</p>

<h4 id="point-system-and-scoring">Point System and Scoring</h4>
</center>
<p>Sirjuka Gallery differs from Temple of Temerity in that you will <strong>gain points for performing certain actions</strong> and doing things in certain ways, and <strong>lose them</strong> if you screw up.</p>
<p>Depending on how many points you accumulate by the end of all three platforms in the gallery, you&rsquo;ll be awarded with talents for your glyphs and other goodies. <br>
There are overall bonus point opportunities that apply no matter what platform you are on, and bonus point opportunities specific to each platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ll sum up the former here, and list the latter in their respective sections throughout this guide.</li>
<li>Whenever you gain bonus points for completing one of these requirements, your character will usually say a line of text related to that achievement, so hopefully your screen is constantly filled with speech bubbles.</li>
</ul>

<p>As mentioned before, each of the three platforms have additional ways to score bonus points, and will be mentioned in each section below as they come.</p>
<div id="platform-1">
<h3>Platform 1</h3>
<center>
<h4 id="preparation">Preparation</h4>
</center>
<p>Once you get onto the first platform, you&rsquo;ll see some <strong>mobs attacking a center crystal</strong> and four smaller green crystals (from now on, shards) on the edges of the platform, one <strong>northeast</strong>, <strong>northwest</strong>, <strong>southeast</strong>, and <strong>southwest</strong>.</p>
<p>These shards are fenced in, and they denote the spawn locations of the mobs that will spawn on this platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>From now on, I&rsquo;ll be referring to these locations with the previously mentioned cardinal directions.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about the mobs in the center attacking the crystal; <strong>they do no damage to the crystal</strong>, so there&rsquo;s <strong>no rush</strong> to kill them.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NZ3qk8p.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If your <strong>tank is a warrior</strong>, it&rsquo;s usually not a bad idea for him/her to go assault stance; there isn&rsquo;t much important to hold aggro on, as most of the crucial mobs that need to be killed before they reach center cannot be aggro&rsquo;d.</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s usually no need to swap out glyphs for damage glyphs unless your party damage dealers are really bad at their job.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the bonus points for healing a party member at critical health are usually too risky to go for (and since healers have their hands full with jockeys), it is usually standard to <strong>just get the bonus at the beginning of the platform and have everyone focus on their roles</strong> for the rest of the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>To get the bonus, have a party member get down to critical health before the platform begins and just heal him/her once the platform starts.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s <strong>no point in having more than one player do so due to the cooldown on the bonus</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are <strong>ways to lower health for the immediate saving party member bonus</strong>, depending on the members in your party:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Warriors</strong> - spam combative strike ; begin the casting of smoke aggressor and cancel with death from above or evasive roll</li>
<li><strong>Berzerkers</strong> - unchained anger; overcharge lethal strike and other skills and block cancel</li>
<li><strong>Archers</strong> - overcharge skills</li>
<li><strong>Other classes</strong> - duel each other</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DPS and TANK</strong> should each go to one of the crystals around the edge of the platform and start whittling their health down (if you have a lancer tank, send him to the northeast crystal so he can grab aggro on the first wave of mobs after the red ones, otherwise send your highest dps; this isn&rsquo;t too important though).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NOT DESTROY THEM</strong>, just bring them down to around 5% or so, use your judgement. As you near 30-50% health you might want to start just using normal attacks since a stray crit can lose you 1000 points.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Once your crystal is prepped, tell your party and just wait beside it and begin spamming jump</strong> (it&rsquo;s a good idea to keep that bound to a different key than your chained skill key.</p>
<p><strong>HEALER</strong> will go to the middle and start whittling the health of the mobs there down.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DO NOT KILL THEM YET.</strong> Wait until each person at a crystal gives you a ready flag that their crystal is prepped at low health.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Once everyone&rsquo;s buffed and ready, finish the mobs off to start the platform.</strong> Lancer tanks can activate Guardian Shout when the party is almost ready.</p>

<p>As soon as all the mobs in the middle are killed by the healer, a timer and on-screen message will appear. <br>
<strong>Bonus point opportunities</strong> can be claimed as long as this timer is up.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>DPS (&amp; TANK)</strong> should break their crystals as soon as the timer starts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediately, a giant red mob (Colossal Deskera Imp) will spawn at your location and make a beeline for the center crystal.
<ul>
<li>They are unaggroable, so kill them quickly.</li>
<li>They get knocked over fairly easily, so be sure you don&rsquo;t knock it too far away from yourself as you try and kill it with a normal attack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/HrrV3b4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As soon as you finish, head to the <strong>northeast side</strong> of the platform in preparation for the first group of mobs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Funnily enough, the Deskera Imp is the kill required by instance matching, so if you instance matched into the dungeon, you should receive a parcel post with your Valkyon&rsquo;s Response as soon as a party member kills one.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any party members decided to get themselves to critical before the platform started, the <strong>HEALER should heal them as soon as possible</strong> then immediately assume jockey duty.</p>
<p>The <strong>healer&rsquo;s job</strong> is to prevent the <strong>Lab Jockeys from reaching the crystal</strong> and throwing their bombs (they hit HARD).</p>
<ul>
<li>They appear at set intervals randomly at any one of the four spawns, are unaggroable, and make a beeline for the crystal.</li>
<li>Use sleeps, slows, and stuns anytime you need to.</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re prone to knockdowns as well, so use that fact to your advantage and keep your knockdown skill on cooldown.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FVRwHmD.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A good tactic is usually to sleep the jockey as soon as you see it, then start off your damage rotation with your knockdown skill.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re having trouble spotting jockeys, use your compass to help out; it&rsquo;s range is enough to cover the entire platform if you stand in the center, so just watch for the orange dots that appear on the edges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you still pan around the platform manually though, as sometimes you won&rsquo;t see the jockey if it&rsquo;s in the midst of a bunch of other mobs.</p>
<p>Generally the <strong>healer will be enough for this job</strong>, but if he/she isn&rsquo;t confident or you&rsquo;re doing a learning run, the tank can help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually if your party damage is enough, the <strong>TANK</strong> can prioritize jockeys over other mobs, and should come help kill them as needed with his/her stuns and knockdowns if they get near the crystal.</li>
<li>If it helps, <strong>tank and healer can divide the platform between them</strong> to kill jockeys faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next mobs will spawn <strong>northeast</strong> where the <strong>DPS (&amp; TANK)</strong> are waiting.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kill these mobs; the <strong>TANK can pull aggro on these</strong> when they first spawn to help out the damage dealers; as soon as these are killed (normal attacks please), head back to the middle of the arena to kill the archers that have spawned.</li>
<li>If you happen to see a jockey run past you, <strong>feel free to kill it as well</strong>, but don&rsquo;t make it a priority (they&rsquo;re the healer&rsquo;s job) unless it&rsquo;s too close to the crystal for comfort.</li>
<li>As soon as there are only a few archers at low health left to kill, <strong>leave one DPS to finish them off and have the rest of the DPS head over to thesouthwest side</strong> of the platform.
<ul>
<li>Generally, whoever has the most slows (such as a sorcerer or archer) should be the first to peel off and greet any new mobs that are spawning in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At <strong>southwest</strong> spawn after the archer mobs, <strong>DPS (&amp; TANK)</strong> will need to kill the Ossugon Tyrant that has just spawned in; he cannot be aggro&rsquo;d so slow him down as much as you can and kill him before he reaches the center; soon after, a pair of gulon hunters will spawn from the same spot; they also cannot be aggro&rsquo;d, so kill them as soon as possible with the help of your slows. As these hunters grow close to dead, the DPSshould begin peeling off to head to the <strong>northeastern side of the platform</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Northeast</strong>, four Thulsan elite soldiers will spawn <strong>that will absolutely DESTROY your crystal if you let them get to the center</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure at least one damage dealer is there to greet them, preferably with slows.</li>
<li><strong>Unleash hell on these guys and use whatever you can to slow them down</strong> (stuns are useless, but endurance debuffs work wonders).</li>
<li>The TANK can pull aggro on these guys to help divert their attention for a few seconds, but remember they hit like a bus (definitely go stalwart cruxes if you decide to do this.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel like you won&rsquo;t make it before these guys reach the crystal, don&rsquo;t push yourself to normal attack the last hit on these guys, as the amount of damage they can deal to your crystal is not worth the risk <em>(one hit pretty much negates your 75% health bonus opportunity)</em>.</p>
<p>After those are dead, <strong>DPS (&amp; TANK)</strong> should head back to the northeast side to greet the gallery ghilliedhus that are beginning to spawn in ( unaggroable).</p>
<ul>
<li>These will spawn clockwise around the platform, one at each spawn, so as one ghilliedhu is near dead, DPS should start to peel off and head to the next spawn point clockwise; do this until all four ghilliedhus are dead.</li>
<li>Having everyone start at the <strong>northeastern ghilliedhu speeds killing</strong>, so do that.
<ul>
<li>While you usually won&rsquo;t have trouble with these mobs, they do happen to do a huge amount of damage with their attacks as well, so don&rsquo;t let them get to the crystal either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the ghilliedhus are dead, <strong>THE WHOLE PARTY should be jumping for the bonus points</strong> and on jockey duty.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT STOP UNTIL THE CENTER CRYSTAL DISAPPEARS</strong>, as jockeys will continue to spawn in until the platform is officially over.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the crystal disappears, you&rsquo;re safe to prep for the next platform.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr/>
<div id="platform-2">
<h3>Platform 2</h3>
<center>
<h4 id="preparation-1">Preparation</h4>
</center>
<p>Like the first platform, there will be shards along the perimeter of the platform, except this time, there are only three.</p>
<ul>
<li>They&rsquo;re <strong>northeast</strong>,<strong>northwest</strong>, and <strong>south</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The mobs in the center are identical to the ones from the first platform, so rest easy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only really difference in layout is that <em>there are barrels</em> along the northern, southwestern, and southeastern sides of the platform.</li>
<li><strong>THESE BARRELS WILL ONE-SHOT YOU</strong>, so <strong>don&rsquo;t touch them</strong> if at all possible.
<ul>
<li>Leave them to the tank.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/6mZ8HHn.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>TANKS</strong> should note that it is important to keep aggro on all of their assigned BAMs for this platform; once these BAMS reach the crystal, it will be close to impossible to pull them off without the center crystal taking damage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Be careful not to venture too far away from the BAMs you need to kite, or else you&rsquo;ll lose aggro rather quickly to the center crystal.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Warrior tanks</strong> should switch back to defensive stance and tanking glyphs now if they haven&rsquo;t already.</p>
<p>There will be <strong>three teraliths on this platform</strong> that you will not want to kill, but instead, keep knocked-down for the bonus points they give. Teralith 1 will spawn in from the northeastern spawn, teralith 2 from the northwest, and teralith 3 from the south.</p>
<ul>
<li>Designate <strong>one DPS</strong>(probably the melee class with the least amount of overall dps) to knockdown teralith 1 (I&rsquo;ll refer to the designated person as <strong>DPST</strong> from now on)</li>
<li>The <strong>HEALER</strong> will be assigned to teraliths 2 &amp; 3 (if healer will have trouble, have the tank assigned to 3); more on that below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Double check that you know your knockdown skills. It should be noted that teraliths gain knockdown resistance every time they get knocked down, so you don&rsquo;t have all the time in the world to kill the other BAMs.</p>
<p>Feel free to have a party member go critical for the healing bonus again, as long as it&rsquo;s not the tank this time.</p>
<p><strong>DPS &amp; TANK</strong> should each go to a crystal and start whittling their health down; make sure TANK takes the <strong>northeastern</strong> crystal alone or is waiting near it alone before the platform is started, as the first BAM he/she needs to kite spawns there.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since there are only three shards on this platform, one damage dealer will often be left behind.</li>
<li>Preferably, this dps will be the one getting his/her health down to critical; if this is the case, have him/her wait by the healer in the <strong>middle</strong> for a quick heal right after the platform starts. <strong>Otherwise, wait northwest.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HEALER</strong> will go to the <strong>middle</strong> and start whittling the health of the mobs there down; wait until each person at a crystal gives you a ready flag that their crystal is prepped at low health. Once everyone&rsquo;s ready, kill the mobs to start the platform.</p>
<p>Lancer tanks can activate Guardian Shout when the party is almost ready.</p>

<p><strong>TANK</strong> should grab aggro as soon as possible from the hydrath that just spawned at the northeast.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that the center crystal is constantly generating aggro, so an orange aggro circle isn&rsquo;t enough, you&rsquo;ll likely need to go through your rotation as you kite him to keep its attention.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Get the aggro you need</strong> (usually enough attacks to get it down to 90% health) before luring it to the barrels on the northern side of the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring it within range of two or three of the barrels before leashing/death from aboving the barrels (lancer tanks should make sure you are out of range of the barrels, warriors can just death from above the barrels since the invulnerability frames will keep you save).
<strong>As soon as you&rsquo;ve killed it, head to the southern spawn point and wait there jumping.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ETGg2Nv.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>DPS &amp; HEALER</strong> should not interfere with this whole process and should instead congregate northwest, where the juggernaut will spawn.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the second BAM on the platform and will spawn immediately after the tank kills the first BAM.
<ul>
<li>Drop your slows and damage as soon as it spawns in.</li>
<li><strong>Teralith 1 (northeast)</strong> will likely spawn in at this time, so when it does (there will be a notice on your screen), <strong>DPST should break off to go keep that teralith in permanent knockdown</strong> (be careful not to kill it, cast only your knockdown skill as it goes off cooldown).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the juggernaut is dead, have the rest of the <strong>DPS join DPST up on the northeastern side</strong> and just wait there <em>jumping</em> (you&rsquo;ve been doing that throughout this entire dungeon right?), only helping out the DPST if the teralith gets outside the spawning area.</p>
<ul>
<li>The HEALER should wait at the <strong>northwestern</strong> spawn for the second teralith.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DPST should make sure you do your best to knockdown the teralith</strong> so that it gets knocked back to the edge of the platform, as the last BAM will be spawning in that location, and you don&rsquo;t want to accidentally kill the teralith with your bigger aoe skills if possible.</p>
<p>The <strong>third BAM, a fangspawn</strong>, will spawn south as soon as the juggernaut dies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have the <strong>TANK grab as much aggro</strong> as possible as soon as it appears (you might need to go through your full aggro rotation once or twice, this one is very picky).</li>
<li>Once it&rsquo;s onto you, <strong>kite it to thesouthwestern barrels and hurt it with the explosion</strong> (try and get it within range of around 4 barrels, as the number of barrels that explode near it affect how much health it loses; 4 will push it below 50% health).</li>
<li>This won&rsquo;t be enough to kill it, so grab a bit more aggro then kite it to <strong>thesoutheastern</strong> barrels to finish it off (go for at least 4 barrels in range again, mandatory if you weren&rsquo;t able to do so with the first set).
<ul>
<li>Once it&rsquo;s dead, <strong>immediately head to the northeastern</strong> spawn to help kill the final BAM and/or help knockdown the first teralith.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HEALER</strong> should be using their knockdown skills to keep the second teralith that spawns northwest in permaknockdown (doesn&rsquo;t hurt to swap a glyph out for decreased cooldown if you haven&rsquo;t already).</p>
<ul>
<li>Once the third teralith spawns south, you&rsquo;ll need to <strong>juggle knockdowns</strong> between the two.</li>
<li>Use sleeps, stuns, and slows as necessary.</li>
<li>Always keep an eye on both teraliths and hope your damage dealers and tank can kill the final BAM before both teraliths reach the middle.
<ul>
<li><strong>Remember that teraliths gain knockdown resistance each time they are knocked down.</strong> A good tactic is usually to spam knockdowns on the second teralith until you&rsquo;re notified that the third teralith has spawned in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Wait for the second teralith to get up from your last knockdown and sleep it before running over to the third teralith and knocking down that one a few times until your first sleep wears off (click on the teralith so you can keep track of this!).</p>
<ul>
<li>At that point you can use your own judgment when juggling teraliths.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DPS &amp; TANK</strong> should be wailing on the <strong>last BAM up northeast</strong> as soon as it spawns; throw all the slows and endurance debuffs you can onto it, and always keep them stacked. <strong>DPST</strong> should be bouncing back and forth between the BAM and his/her teralith at this point unless it becomes clear that there won&rsquo;t be enough damage to finish the last BAM off before it reaches the center.</p>
<ul>
<li>The same goes with the tank and his/her teralith if the healer is only dealing with the second.</li>
<li>If the healer has no problem dealing with the second and third teraliths alone, it&rsquo;s usually a good idea for the TANK to take over knocking down the first teralith so that the <strong>DPST</strong> can join the other DPS in killing the last BAM.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the fourth <strong>BAM is dead, THE WHOLE PARTY should continute jumping</strong> and knocking down teraliths (they can still destroy the crystal if they get too close) until the platform finishes and the crystal disappears.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DO NOT HEAD UP THE RAMP TO THE FINAL PLATFORM, as stepping onto the final ramp will automatically start the last platform.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Over the course of the platform, <strong>the barrels will respawn after they have been blown up</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a warrior or mystic in your party and you have the time to spare, you can summon a shadow or a thrall and send it off to attack a set of barrels.</li>
<li><strong>Since these summons also count as monsters</strong>, you&rsquo;ll still get the 1000 points from their deaths.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just make sure to verify with your tank which sets of barrels he/she doesn&rsquo;t need anymore after some of the BAMs have died (in other words, you should NEVER destroy barrels with summons at the start of the platform).</p>
<ul>
<li>Also, you obviously want to <strong>make sure no one is standing near them</strong> when you do send your suicide summons off to their deaths.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<hr/>
<div id="platform-3">
<h3>Platform 3</h3>
<center>
<h4 id="preparation-2">Preparation</h4>
</center>
<p>On this final platform, there will be a BAM in the center attacking the center crystal (Barkud).</p>
<ul>
<li>He does damage, so only venture onto the bridge leading to the platform once everyone is ready. There are also three shards on the edge once more, but this time they are surrounded by some mobs.</li>
<li><strong>These mobs do no damage, but can knock players down very easily.</strong></li>
<li>On this platform, <strong>you want to ignore these</strong> three shards and their respective mobs if at all possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Barkud</strong> has high crit resistance, so decide beforehand whether to go crit or power depending on party composition.</p>
<p><strong>TANKS</strong> should note that it is important to both keep aggro on Barkud for the entirety of this platform, and get it back quickly at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Tanking position is important, as <strong>Barkud loves to do forward and backward leaps</strong> that can sometimes hit the crystal if you aren&rsquo;t careful.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get him as far away from the center and edge shards as possible before tanking Barkud laterally to the center crystal.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For this platform, if <strong>HEALERS</strong> were going for the saving a party member at critical health bonus points, it is recommended that they no longer do so, as this boss hits way too hard for it to matter, and you&rsquo;ll likely end up getting these points on accident anyway.</p>
<p>For <strong>dps warriors and healers up for a challenge</strong>, the <strong>warrior can strip his/her health away</strong> to below 5% health before going in.</p>

<p>This <strong>whole platform is about keeping aggro on Barkud</strong>, so the <strong>TANK should be the first to head in</strong> once everyone is ready.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have the tank immediately pull aggro and get Barkud away from the crystal.</li>
<li><strong>Tank him in a position away from both the center crystal</strong> and the contaminated shards off to the side, and be sure to hold the boss still as much as possible so your dps can wail on him.
<ul>
<li><strong>If you ever see messages appearing on screen, expect to lose aggro</strong> pretty soon and be prepared to pull aggro back quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Spam your aggro rotation</strong> and/or have all of your threat generating skills on cooldown when possible during this fight.</li>
<li><strong>DPS &amp; HEALER</strong> should fight Barkud like any other BAM, and contribute stuns and slows as necessary to help keep him in place.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/QpD33CY.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you feel that your point total isn&rsquo;t high enough (at least 174,000 going into the third stage is ideal for rank 1) and you can sacrifice some damage, have one or two dps go over to the shards to kill the mobs around them, but <strong>NOT THE SHARDS THEMSELVES</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that these mobs deal no damage but have high knockdown capabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Breaking a shard will lose you the potential 5000 points</strong>, but each shard releases a ghost that can be killed for 1500, so you can earn back 4500 of the points lost. Breaking the shards will also give your party a minute-long damage buff each (one that you hopefully won&rsquo;t need).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Teq34k4.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>THE WHOLE PARTY</strong> should watch out for the tells on Barkud. Other than the normal BAM attacks, Barkud has two sets of jumps that make it annoying to keep in place.</p>
<ul>
<li>For instance, right after Barkud does a <strong>single ground pound with both fists</strong>, it will immediately jump backwards for a bodyslam, and then jump forwards twice as far.</li>
<li>Another example would be after <strong>Barkud raises both fists</strong> in the air and pummels the ground for a while with the screen shaking; it&rsquo;ll often do a forward jump right after.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on its positioning, <strong>you&rsquo;ll want to either throw all the stuns you have at the right time</strong> or let Barkud jump further away to help with repositioning.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the <strong>TANK&rsquo;S priority should be to keep Barkud&rsquo;s aggro</strong> on himself/herself and off of the crystal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once that&rsquo;s no longer a problem, you can start thinking about where to position Barkud.</li>
<li>Because of its forward and backward jumps, you want to make sure that <strong>Barkud doesn&rsquo;t accidentally jump on top of either the center crystal</strong> or the surrounding shards.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>best place to do so will be between two of the shards with the tank with his/her back against the edge of the platform</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>At this distance, the backflip bodyslam move will not reach the center crystal, and you will be able to block both of the forward jumps without worrying about boss movement.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget to keep up aggro though</strong>, since it&rsquo;ll be bad if Barkud turns away from you and heads toward the center crystal.
<ul>
<li>If Barkud is acting noncompliant, <strong>you can try tanking it laterally</strong> between the center crystal and one of the outlying shards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That way, if it does happen to jump forwards or backwards, it won&rsquo;t jump onto any of the shards and you can try to force him up against the wall.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/UUBF3u9.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Barkud hits hard.</strong> Very hard. Two or three of its attacks are enough to kill pretty much anyone in the party.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its bodyslams from jumps do an extraordinary amount of damage as well.</li>
<li><strong>Ranged damage dealers and healers should never stand directly behind</strong> or in front of the boss without any good reason unless they are familiar with the tells of the boss and can dodge away when necessary (I&rsquo;ve seen plenty of clothies get one-shot in my time).</li>
<li><strong>Melee damage dealers should learn the tells as well, as the backwards jump will still hit you</strong> if you stay in the same place directly behind Barkud while dealing damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important for all party members to stay alive at this point, as multiple deaths can push you down a rank fairly quickly.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you brought potions along, now is the time to use them. Then again you should have been using consumables throughout this dungeon anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>At <strong>below 10% health, Barkud will run to the center</strong> of the room next to the crystal and a dragon <strong>(Jermir!)</strong> will arrive.</p>
<ul>
<li>As you approach this percentage <em>(around 15%)</em> you want to <em>stop using any stuns and attacks that apply a slow</em>, as you need Barkud to run to the center and make it in time to be breathed on by Jermir&rsquo;s dragon breath.</li>
<li>Keep up the damage if you wish but be sure to not use stuns and slows, and <em>leave Barkud alive long enough</em> so that the dragon can breath fire onto him.
<ul>
<li>As soon as Barkud reaches the center, everyone should switch to <em>ONLY normal attacks</em>, since once <strong>Barkud gets hit with the dragon breath</strong>, it will be <strong>one-shottable</strong>, so use normal attacks from that point on to get both the dragon-assist bonus and the normal attack bonus.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you notice that <strong>Barkud doesn&rsquo;t immediately die</strong> from your normal attacks after the dragon has breathed its fire and disappeared, you didn&rsquo;t make it in time for the dragon-assist bonus, so just use skills some more before you normal attack finish it off so you at least get that bonus.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your party is comfortable with it and you have the time to spare, you can start to tank Barkud closer to the crystal when it gets near 10% so that it has more time to run to center for the dragon breath.</p>
