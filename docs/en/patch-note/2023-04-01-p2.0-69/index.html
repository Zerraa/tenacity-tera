PvE As for our upcoming content, we&rsquo;ve been hard at work and hope to have more solid previews soon. As previously mentioned, this is our largest patch to date and we want to make it as good as we can; only showing previews when we can guarantee its quality. We understand that some of you may feel burnt out with our current content, but our stance on this for now is that we&rsquo;d rather take our time to assure quality than to rush a poor product.

The entire team is working hard to make it the best it can be, but we&rsquo;re not ready to share more details yet. If you want to refresh your memory on what we&rsquo;ve revealed this far, you can follow the previous link.

We are excited to announce that we have just released a massive patch for our beloved MMORPG. This patch contains so many changes that we can&rsquo;t even list them all here. Seriously, it would take us hours to write down everything we have done to improve your gaming experience. Some of the changes are big, some are small, some are obvious, some are subtle, some are game-changing, some are cosmetic, some are bug fixes, some are new features, some are balance tweaks, some are quality of life improvements, some are surprises, some are secrets, and some are&hellip; well, you&rsquo;ll have to find out for yourself.

Class Changes Brawler Growing Fury&rsquo;s Irregular Optimization NEW: Increases damage from behind by 10% and overall damage by 69.7%. OLD: Increases damage from behind by 10% and overall damage by 73%. Design Note: This change will result in a 1.5% damage nerf when using Irregular Growing Fury.
Gunner [PvE] Fixed a bug which caused the class to deal much more damage than intended. Reaper Fixed a bug where Shadow Reaping could not be dispelled with Regression or Plague of Exhaustion.

Future Plans While this patch cycle and its dungeons are coming to a close, the entire team is hard at work on a big content patch. We promise that this upcoming patch is bigger and better than anything we&rsquo;ve done before, and includes major changes for both PvE and PvP. Additionally, we even hope to include proper translations in full for French and German. The entire team is incredibly excited, and we can&rsquo;t wait to share more information with you.

          PvP Overview We&rsquo;re aware of and have been listening closely to the community&rsquo;s concerns centered around the overall state of PvP balancing. As stated before, we&rsquo;re going to be doing continual changes over a long period. Our immediate goal was to foster the community back to life to get games popping and make the content playable before sinking our teeth deep into balancing. We&rsquo;re aware that our work has just begun, and we understand that we&rsquo;re nowhere near ready to relax yet.

          This time around, we&rsquo;ve been focusing a lot of our time on PvP. We&rsquo;ve snuck in some PvE changes here and there, but those interested in PvE should stay tuned for patches in the next couple of weeks.
Many of the changes are our first steps toward balancing many different aspects of PvP in MT The Dream. We continue to ask for your patience while we do so, as balancing every part of the game in one patch is not possible.

A number of dungeons in the current PVE roster, ranging from entry-level dungeons to dungeons of the highest difficulty, have been reworked to not only bring boss HP values in-line with the balancing of classes that come with Patch 1.4, but should also make content that may previously have been a burden, more enjoyable to run. Naturally, these adjustments are subject to change, so we&rsquo;ll be reviewing the state of content and learning from your feedback in the coming weeks.

<h2 id="pvp-content">PvP Content</h2>
<h4 id="open-world-pvp">Open World PvP</h4>
<p>We have some important news to share with you today. After careful consideration and feedback from our community, we have decided to remove the open world player versus player (PvP) feature from our game. We know this may come as a shock to some of you, but we believe this is the best decision for the health and happiness of our players. Why did we make this decision? Well, to put it simply, open world PvP was causing too much toxicity in our game. We have received countless reports of griefing, harassment, camping, and other forms of unsportsmanlike behavior from players who abused the PvP system. Some players even went as far as to create multiple accounts and use hacks and exploits to ruin the experience for others. This was not the kind of fun and immersive gameplay we envisioned when we created our game.</p>
<ul>
<li>Due to heavy toxicity, open world PvP has been disabled.
<ul>
<li>Outlaw Declaration has been deactivated and upon login will be removed.</li>
<li>All zones have been made GvG safe.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Dragon pit now contains two dragons rather than one.
<ul>
<li>The dragons spawn at the same time and have different elements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Baron Nashor has been replaced by a Giant Teemo.
<ul>
<li>Giant Teemo has the abilities of a normal Teemo, but scaled up to match his size.</li>
<li>When you enter Giant Teemo&rsquo;s vision, he will perform a global taunt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inhibitors now respawn with full HP after 30 seconds.</li>
<li>The Nexus now fights back and gains a health bonus equivalent to 10% of all Champion&rsquo;s maximum HP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Competitive (5v5)</p>
<ul>
<li>Added a new map called Dust 3 to the map pool.
<ul>
<li>Dust 3 is a remake of Dust 2 with enhanced graphics, layout and gameplay features.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed Dust 2 from the map pool.</li>
<li>Adjusted FAMAS and Galil recoil to make them more realistic and reliable.</li>
<li>Reduced the cost of the AK-47 by $100.</li>
<li>Increased damage of M4A1-S by 5.</li>
<li>Reduced the amount of time a planted bomb is active before exploding by 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Increased the time it takes to defuse the bomb by 1 second.</li>
<li>Fixed several bugs that allowed players to bypass map boundaries or cause server crashes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leaderboard-changes">Leaderboard Changes</h2>
<p>*Design Note: *<em>We&rsquo;ve been discussing what we want to do with leaderboards for a few patches now. The team has spent a lot of time attempting to balance classes, which results in a lot of time taken on our part that could&rsquo;ve been spent on other parts of the game. Of course, balancing has also caused a lot of arguments internally as well as among the broader community. Collectively, we&rsquo;ve decided that it would be better to change how leaderboards work to ensure that everyone in the community is happy. We will not be keeping an eye on this feature and we will not revert it.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>All runs uploaded automatically get first place, resulting in a tie for all participants.

The slayer is a self-sufficient and independent class that doesn&rsquo;t need anyone&rsquo;s help.</strong> The slayer is not a class that anyone can play, but only those who have the courage and the skill to master it. The slayer can tank, DPS, heal, CC, solo, group, PvP, PvE, you name it. The slayer can adapt to any challenge and overcome any obstacle. The slayer can make friends with anyone and enemies with no one. The slayer can enjoy the game to the fullest and never get bored or frustrated.</em></p>

<p>*Design Notes: This patch fixes every single bug that has ever plagued any program, device, or system in the world. Yes, you read that right. Every. Single. Bug. We have fixed everything from the blue screen of death in Windows to the kernel panic in Linux to the spinning beach ball of doom in Mac OS. We have fixed everything from the red ring of death in Xbox to the yellow light of death in PlayStation to the black screen of death in Nintendo Switch. We have even fixed the obscure and forgotten bugs that only affected the PlayStation Vita, because we care about every single user. **How did we do it, you ask? Well, we can&rsquo;t reveal our secret sauce, but let&rsquo;s just say we have some very talented and dedicated developers who have mastered the art of debugging. They have used their skills and knowledge to create a patch that is flawless, elegant, and efficient. They have also tested it extensively on every possible platform and scenario to ensure its compatibility and stability.<br>
