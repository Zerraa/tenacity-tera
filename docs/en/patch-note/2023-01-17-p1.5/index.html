PvE As for our upcoming content, we&rsquo;ve been hard at work and hope to have more solid previews soon. As previously mentioned, this is our largest patch to date and we want to make it as good as we can; only showing previews when we can guarantee its quality. We understand that some of you may feel burnt out with our current content, but our stance on this for now is that we&rsquo;d rather take our time to assure quality than to rush a poor product.

We are excited to announce that we have just released a massive patch for our beloved MMORPG. This patch contains so many changes that we can&rsquo;t even list them all here. Seriously, it would take us hours to write down everything we have done to improve your gaming experience. Some of the changes are big, some are small, some are obvious, some are subtle, some are game-changing, some are cosmetic, some are bug fixes, some are new features, some are balance tweaks, some are quality of life improvements, some are surprises, some are secrets, and some are&hellip; well, you&rsquo;ll have to find out for yourself.

Class Changes Brawler Growing Fury&rsquo;s Irregular Optimization NEW: Increases damage from behind by 10% and overall damage by 69.7%. OLD: Increases damage from behind by 10% and overall damage by 73%. Design Note: This change will result in a 1.5% damage nerf when using Irregular Growing Fury.
Gunner [PvE] Fixed a bug which caused the class to deal much more damage than intended. Reaper Fixed a bug where Shadow Reaping could not be dispelled with Regression or Plague of Exhaustion.

Future Plans While this patch cycle and its dungeons are coming to a close, the entire team is hard at work on a big content patch. We promise that this upcoming patch is bigger and better than anything we&rsquo;ve done before, and includes major changes for both PvE and PvP. Additionally, we even hope to include proper translations in full for French and German. The entire team is incredibly excited, and we can&rsquo;t wait to share more information with you.

          PvP Overview We&rsquo;re aware of and have been listening closely to the community&rsquo;s concerns centered around the overall state of PvP balancing. As stated before, we&rsquo;re going to be doing continual changes over a long period. Our immediate goal was to foster the community back to life to get games popping and make the content playable before sinking our teeth deep into balancing.

          This time around, we&rsquo;ve been focusing a lot of our time on PvP. We&rsquo;ve snuck in some PvE changes here and there, but those interested in PvE should stay tuned for patches in the next couple of weeks.
Many of the changes are our first steps toward balancing many different aspects of PvP in Menma&rsquo;s TERA. We continue to ask for your patience while we do so, as balancing every part of the game in one patch is not possible.

A number of dungeons in the current PVE roster, ranging from entry-level dungeons to dungeons of the highest difficulty, have been reworked to not only bring boss HP values in-line with the balancing of classes that come with Patch 1.4, but should also make content that may previously have been a burden, more enjoyable to run. Naturally, these adjustments are subject to change, so we&rsquo;ll be reviewing the state of content and learning from your feedback in the coming weeks.

      <p class="text-sm text-slate-500 !mb-8">January 17, 2023</p>
      

      

      <p>The last year has been a blast, and we as a team have come a long way from when we first started working on this project. We&rsquo;ve learnt a ton, largely in part to your constructive feedback and efforts from the community.
We&rsquo;re now looking into taking things to the next level in the coming year. This small patch wraps up a number of events, and it also wraps up a few projects started in the previous year including changes to the Island of Dawn and the boss pet system.</p>
<p>More detail will come in the future as things are ironed out, but our plans for the upcoming year include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creating a new gear set, alongside a new roster of dungeons.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tidying up existing systems and providing a more streamlined experience for both new and returning players.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Creating additional gameplay loops and systems of progression.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While previous patches have been rich in the amount of changes made, there are still a few core issues we&rsquo;re looking to address.
Systems like tailoring and the battle pass event (which we&rsquo;ll be bringing back for sure) have been well received and we&rsquo;re looking to add more content like this, however ultimately previous patches have been largely focused on maintenance rather than growth.
Ultimately our goal is to grow TERA and make it the best it could be, so we ask for your continued patience and feedback while we work on making exciting new content.</p>
