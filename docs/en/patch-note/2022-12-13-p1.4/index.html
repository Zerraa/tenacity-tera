          PVE Content Changes Design Note
A number of dungeons in the current PVE roster, ranging from entry-level dungeons to dungeons of the highest difficulty, have been reworked to not only bring boss HP values in-line with the balancing of classes that come with Patch 1.4, but should also make content that may previously have been a burden, more enjoyable to run. Naturally, these adjustments are subject to change, so we&rsquo;ll be reviewing the state of content and learning from your feedback in the coming weeks.

          Menma’s Hunter Event (Battle Pass) After reviewing feedback from the community, we’ve decided to make some significant changes to the Battle Pass system. Alongside a wealth of quality of life improvements, the new Dungeon Mission Box now contains 2 new “Mission Tickets,” allowing players to select specific dungeons they’d like to run. Dungeons within the “Dungeon Group Mission” boxes have also been amended. We hope these changes make it slightly more enjoyable to complete your Battle Pass!

<p><em>Design Note</em></p>
<p><em>A number of dungeons in the current PVE roster, ranging from entry-level dungeons to dungeons of the highest difficulty, have been reworked to not only bring boss HP values in-line with the balancing of classes that come with Patch 1.4, but should also make content that may previously have been a burden, more enjoyable to run. Naturally, these adjustments are subject to change, so we&rsquo;ll be reviewing the state of content and learning from your feedback in the coming weeks. We are also in the process of looking into reworking lower-tired dungeons and the new player experience as a whole in upcoming patches.</em></p>

<h2 id="pve-class-changes">PVE Class Changes</h2>
<p><em>Design Note</em></p>
<p><em>The following class changes, namely changes to party-buff and steroid cooldowns aim to create synergy between every class, encouraging a much needed diversity in competitive party compositions, while reducing healer/tank biases. With this, all DPS classes have also been brought to the level of Reaper, reducing the discrepancy in damage across the board and allowing all players to now compete in leaderboard dungeons. There have also been a number of QoL improvements to nearly all classes, in an effort to maintain its identity while still being enjoyable. With this patch, all party compositions should be capable of syncing buffs in one way or another, with any combination of tank and healer.</em></p>
<p><em>As for the state of tanks, Brawler has been out-performing the likes of Lancer and Warrior Tank in the last patch, particularly due to it&rsquo;s near-perfect synergy with most classes and ability to gain self-damage from consistent boss attacks. Thus, the rework to our main line-up of tanks should alleviate any concerns around party compositions in regards to synergy and party-damage.</em></p>
<p><em>With such significant changes comes more room for error, and so we&rsquo;ll be reviewing closely how these changes impact all areas of the game and amending in the near future. Nearly all changes listed below are specifically for PVE only.</em></p>
<h4 id="ninja">Ninja</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Piercing Gaze:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased damage from 5% per stack to 20%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Harmonious Piercing Gaze:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased damage from 10% per stack to 40%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyclic Chi:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased crit chance from 30% to 50%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impact Bomb:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 15 seconds to 13 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inner Harmony:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 180 seconds to 165 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fire Avalanche:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced Chi cost from 1000 to 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 180 seconds to 85 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased skill damage gained from 5% to 11%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smoke Bomb:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can no longer i-frame Nightmare Commander Kalligar&rsquo;s puddle mechanic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smoke bomb now only affects the caster and not party members.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ninja was in a niche spot, lacking in sustain while having a very awkward burst window and offering unparalleled utility with Smoke Bomb. These changes aim to rework Ninja, replacing its party utility which no other damage-dealing class can offer with increased raw damage. Inner Harmony cooldown has been slightly reduced to properly sync with any party composition. Fire Avalanche costing Chi meant that using it over Burning Heart was actually a DPS loss and never worth doing, due to being unable to lower the Attunement cooldown with further Burning Heart casts. Now at 56s and no Chi cost, this offers mini bursts at sync intervals, without worrying about falling into the trap of a longer Attunement cast. Impact Bomb cooldown reduction will reduce awkward periods where needing to cast Burning Heart and Impact Bomb is still on cooldown. Finally, Cyclic Chi will help to increase Burning Heart and Boomerang crit rate, aiding with Ninjas sustain damage outside of burn.</p>
<h4 id="berserker">Berserker</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bloodlust:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased power gained from 29 to 60.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased damage to monsters from 10% to 20%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 180 seconds to 73 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced duration from 30 seconds to 24 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flurry of Blows:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base duration from 18 seconds to 32 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unleash:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base cooldown to 260 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cyclone:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed issue where players could not chain Lethal Strike after the final Cyclone reset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed issue where casting a chain skill between Stage 3 and Stage 4 of Cyclone would put Cyclone on CD regardless of reset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&lsquo;Cycloning&rsquo; Buff:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased maximum stack count from 10 to 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased duration from 9.5 seconds to 12.5 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lethal Strike:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 7 seconds to 5 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed bug where Lethal Strike would use mana instead of 2% HP on cast. Lethal Strike will now correctly use 2% HP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evasive smash:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damage now applies as physical damage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical and magical factor changed to 165% physical and 135% magical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added &lsquo;Carving Flatten&rsquo; glyph:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Triples the chance to crit when attacking monsters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costs 3 glyph points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added &lsquo;Carving Vampiric Blow&rsquo; glyph:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Triples the chance to crit when attacking monsters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Costs 3 glyph points.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes aimed to increase Berserker&rsquo;s damage outside of Unleash. Berserkers can now maintain 100% uptime on Flurry of Blows if played correctly, thanks to the duration increase and Bloodlust rework. Bloodlust will now have a 58 second cooldown with 24 seconds of uptime, so Berserkers will have a bit more burst at 60 second intervals outside of Unleash. The Cycloning buff was painful to drop (and quite easily so in the current roster of dungeons), so these changes aim to lessen the impact of losing these stacks. Flatten and Vampiric Blow received triple crit glyphs, making these filler skills more consistent.</p>
<h4 id="berserker-tank">Berserker Tank</h4>
<ul>
<li>Removed Silent rage debuff when Flurry of Blows buff expires.<br>
(&ldquo;Flurry of Blows will not activate again for 20 sec once the effect ends.&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Flurry of Blows can now Refresh itself.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>And a lot more to come soon</em></p>
<h4 id="lancer">Lancer</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adrenaline Rush:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 110 seconds to 80 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased attack speed gained from 32% to 25% for party members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased skill damage gained from 15.5% to 12% for party members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased duration by 5 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attack Speed and Skill Damage are unchanged for the Lancer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Guardian Shout:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 110 seconds to 80 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased duration from 45 seconds to 34 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased weapon attack modifier of Kaia&rsquo;s Fury Lance from 44,516 to 56,259.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased weapon attack modifier of Annihilation Lances appropriately.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes to Lancer&rsquo;s party buffs should allow all classes to sync their steroid abilities with Adrenaline Rush and Guardian Shout more comfortably, making Lancer-based party compositions able to compete in leaderboard dungeons where it previously struggled. In addition to this, Lancer&rsquo;s personal damage has been buffed significantly where it was previously lacking in comparison to other tanks.</p>
<h4 id="archer">Archer</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Windsong:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 85 to 80 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Windsong (Gale) now applies Strong Wind buff for 20 seconds:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[PvE Only] &ndash; Increases skill damage of Gust Arrow by 70% while the buff is active.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sequential Fire:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 5 seconds to 4 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Focus:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased crit power granted from 0.8 to 1.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feign Death:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feign Death no longer drops aggro or removes the caster from combat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feign Death now grants Second Breath buff which increases combat movement speed by 80 for 5 seconds upon use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Archer&rsquo;s current playstyle involves utilising unintended game mechanics in order to achieve its maximum amount of damage. This issue has been solved with a change to Feign Death&rsquo;s interaction and a variety of buffs in other areas to compensate. Windsong cooldown has been reduced further to allow proper syncing with new 60 second burst intervals across all party compositions. However, this introduced another issue in which Gust Arrow&rsquo;s timing was displaced. Previously, this was cast alongside dragon buffs, which now proc as Windsong comes up. The question of using Gust Arrow in or before Windsong was always a confusing game design and unintuitive, thus, using Gust Arrow in Windsong will now result in more damage, living up to it&rsquo;s expected purpose.</p>
<h4 id="brawler">Brawler</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jackhammer:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjusted the debuff from 3 stacks of 4% endurance reduction to 1 stack of 12%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Brawler is currently in a good spot and this is more a quality of life change, simplifying the opener so players do not either commit too long to Jackhammer or cancel it early at 2 stacks.</p>
<h4 id="warrior">Warrior</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Blade Frenzy:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage from 31,085 to 46,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased physical factor from 170% to 190%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blade Waltz:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 6 seconds to 5.5 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scythe:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 8 seconds to 7 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rain of Blows:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage of both versions from 4,373 to 6,500.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assault Stance:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased skill damage to monsters from 8% to 12%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes should allow players to not only obtain a higher burst with Blade Frenzy&rsquo;s damage increased significantly, but should also address any concerns around being cooldown locked in and outside of Deadly Gamble (particularly with higher attack speeds). In addition to this, the increase to Rain of Blows base damage will make Warrior&rsquo;s gameplay less reliant on Blade Draw resets, while still being adequately rewarded when it does.</p>
<h4 id="warrior-tank">Warrior Tank</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Traverse Cut:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added a new buff: &lsquo;One with the Sword&rsquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Triggers on each successful hit of Traverse Cut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grants 3.5% PvE skill damage to the party (does not apply to self).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lasts for 40 seconds and can be refreshed by additional hits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defensive Stance:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced PvE damage in Defensive Stance by 10%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In an effort to make Warrior Tank more appealing to run with, the new &ldquo;One with the Sword&rdquo; party buff should now allow damage classes to yield higher personal damage. However, Warrior Tank&rsquo;s personal damage increased significantly with the aforementioned changes to Warrior. The result of these changes made the tank stance incredibly strong, thus it&rsquo;s personal damage has been reduced to compensate &ndash; a trade for higher party DPS across the board.</p>
<h4 id="gunner">Gunner</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Modular Weapon System:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 90 seconds to 80 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bombardment:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 100 seconds to 70 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage from 27,773 to 36,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balder&rsquo;s Vengeance:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 240 seconds to 225 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage from 30,346 to 34,000 (increased to 42,000 when under the effects of Modular Weapon System).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obliteration:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 90 seconds to 55 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage from 25,490 to 38,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased projectile speed slightly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arcane Barrage:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage of first hit from 507 to 1,014.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage of second hit from 4,653 to 5,700.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remote Trigger:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage of first hit from 614 to 1,228.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage of second hit from 5,184 to 6,500.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Burst Fire:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage from 191 to 230.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Targeted Burst Fire:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage from 258 to 279.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time Bomb:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage of first hit from 614 to 2,500.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage of second hit from 3,597 to 6,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mana Missiles:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased Willpower generated per missile from 20 to 34.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased weapon attack modifier of Kaia&rsquo;s Wisdom Arcannon from 56559 to 49650.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased weapon attack modifier of Dark Light Arcannons appropriately.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Gunner has been lacking in damage, therefore the damage of skills that should have the same HPM regardless of playstyle have been buffed. The MWS cooldown reduction should help Gunner&rsquo;s synergy with other buffs, and accompanying it are the cooldown reductions of Bombardment and Obliteration for QoL purposes of their use during MWS (prevents cooldowns being out of sync if used separately). The change to Obliteration&rsquo;s projectile speed should, in synergy with the MM projectile number reduction, largely resolve the 15 projectile limit issue, which causes projectiles to disappear when fired after Obliteration.</p>
<h4 id="slayer">Slayer</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unsheathe:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 180 seconds to 170 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage by 15%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eviscerate:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased both Powerlinked Eviscerate glyphs for Overhand Strike and Measured Slice from 25% to 60%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whirlwind:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage by 10%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Punishing Blow:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased base damage by 5%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>EP Changes:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whirlwind Critical Pummel &ndash; Increased the duration from 3s to 8s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Overhand Strike Force &ndash; Increased the chance to proc from 60% to 100%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased weapon attack modifier of Kaia&rsquo;s Fury Greatsword from 59214 to 56400.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased weapon attack modifier of Annihilation Greatswords appropriately.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes, to Eviscerate in particular, should reward players for maintaining higher uptimes on Eviscerate glyphs, resulting in more damage, combined with Whirlwind and Punishing Blow&rsquo;s damage increases to preserve Slayer&rsquo;s current playstyle. The cooldown of Unsheathe has been slightly reduced, to provide better synergy with 1.5/2.0 passives when performing at the peak of Slayer&rsquo;s gameplay. The EP changes on Overhand Strike should improve its consistency during In Cold Blood, while the change to Whirlwind&rsquo;s Critical Pummel provides a similar effect but to its crit rate instead.</p>
<h4 id="sorcerer">Sorcerer</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hailstorm:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Successful hits of Hailstorm now grant stacks of &ldquo;Frozen to the Core&rdquo; buff:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each stack grants 1.8% cooldown reduction for all skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stacks up to 4 times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lasts for 9 seconds and can be refreshed by additional hits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mana Boost:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mana Boost (&ldquo;Mysterious&rdquo; Skill Advancement) now applies &ldquo;Future Sight&rdquo; buff:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduces cooldown of Meteor Strike and Implosion by 8%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increases Damage of Implosion by 75%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nova:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased innate crit rate from 1.1 to 2.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Void Pulse:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased Energetic Void Pulse glyph&rsquo;s effects from 20% cooldown reduction to 30% cooldown reduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arcane Pulse:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 10 seconds to 9 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lightning Strike:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 5 seconds to 4 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fusion:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced base cooldown from 11 seconds to 10 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elemental Fusion remains unchanged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased weapon attack modifier of Kaia&rsquo;s Wisdom Disc from 55874 to 54777.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased weapon attack modifier of Dark Light Discs appropriately.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes aim to fix the main issues Sorcerers had up to now which include; The class being hard cooldown locked even without extra attack speed (and as such limited skill cap), the inability to gain much damage out of (Adrenaline Rush/Traverse Cut/Bravery) attack speeds due to the hard cooldown lock, rendering Sorcerers less valuable with the aforementioned buffs, as well as some skill cooldowns not lining up well overall. The change to Implosion now enables players to use the ability on every second burst now instead of every third, and should now feel like the ultimate ability it is intended to be. Lastly, Nova&rsquo;s innate crit rate has been increased, reducing damage variance when using the ability. In light of these new changes, Sorcerers should now be rewarded for playing their class properly.</p>
<h4 id="valkyrie">Valkyrie</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dreamblaze:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased Runeburst skill damage buff from 15 to 25% per stack.</p>

<li>
<p>Godsfall:</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Skill Advancement &ldquo;Sheen&rdquo;:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed party damage buffs from Arun&rsquo;s Wail and Shara&rsquo;s Scream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casting Titansbane now grants &ldquo;Bloody Eclipse&rdquo; buff for 32s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bloody Eclipse increases skill damage of following skills while Ragnarok is active:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ground Bash and Glaive Strike by 10%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Runeburst by 50%</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Skill Advancement &ldquo;Focus&rdquo;:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increases skill damage of Titansbane by 60%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No longer generates Ragnarok points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shining Crescent:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased Ragnarok points generated when using the Velocity Skill Advancement from 25 to 40 per hit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Glyph changes:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Powerlinked Windslash increased damage from 25% to 100%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bloodflower Powerlink increased damage from 25% to 50%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased weapon attack modifier of Kaia&rsquo;s Fury Runeglaive from 63403 to 65738.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased weapon attack modifier of Annihilation Runeglaives appropriately.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Valkyrie has been revamped with significant changes to the Titansbane Skill Advancements. As a result of the ability going against our goal of synchronising DPS utility and buffs, the Focus Skill Advancement has been reworked into making Titansbane a high damage skill. On the other hand, the Sheen Skill Advancement has been reworked with the idea of adding more variety into Valkyrie gameplay by promoting the usage of Runeburst during Ragnarok as long as the &ldquo;Bloody Eclipse&rdquo; buff is active. When pairing these changes with the increased damage and attack speed, Valkyrie should be back on par with the stronger classes.</p>

<p>Our goal with these changes is to implement a fair and enjoyable playstyle to Mystic, that will reward those who are more support-oriented and damage-oriented equally. Thrall of Wrath&rsquo;s damage has been reduced in order to introduce a higher skill cap to Mystic. Thrall of Wrath has also been given enough defence to make it practically invulnerable. Additionally, Mystic&rsquo;s strongest ability, Arunic Release now wonderfully excels in healing, mana regen, and damage. Boomerang Pulse will now have double its crit rate on both damage and healing, making it easier for support-oriented players to keep themselves and their party alive, while providing a significant damage boost for those who choose to maximise their damage on Mystic. Finally, Mystic&rsquo;s party buffs have been increased, which should lessen the discrepancy in party damage between it and its counterpart, Priest.</p>
<h4 id="priest">Priest</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enabled Velocity and Weakening Touch skill advancements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Longshot Mana Charge (Divine Charge) Glyph:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased range from 50% to 100%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blessing of Shakan Advancement:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changed effect from 36% Base Crit to +20 Crit.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Priest has been in an amazing spot recently, and therefore wasn&rsquo;t in need of much this patch. We wanted to shift away from giving a percentage of base crit on both healer buffs and give a flat number instead, which should benefit most classes as an overall increase in crit. With Velocity being enabled again and Divine Charge range slightly increased, both healers will be able to adequately heal and buff without any issues.</p>
<h4 id="raid-wide-buffs">Raid-Wide Buffs</h4>
<p>A number of party buffs have now been made to work raid-wide:</p>

<p>Changes on &ldquo;2.0&rdquo; Mount Passives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decreased effect from 2.0 to 1.0 Crit Power.</li>
<li>Increased duration from 6s to 14s.</li>
</ul>
<p>Effects now &ldquo;queue&rdquo; up on proc instead of popping and overwriting each other.</p>
