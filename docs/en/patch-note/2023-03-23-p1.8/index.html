We know many of you are interested in our upcoming big patch, which we teased briefly in Patch 1.8. The entire team is working hard to make it the best it can be, but we&rsquo;re not ready to share more details yet. If you want to refresh your memory on what we&rsquo;ve revealed this far, you can follow the previous link.

PvE As for our upcoming content, we&rsquo;ve been hard at work and hope to have more solid previews soon. As previously mentioned, this is our largest patch to date and we want to make it as good as we can; only showing previews when we can guarantee its quality. We understand that some of you may feel burnt out with our current content, but our stance on this for now is that we&rsquo;d rather take our time to assure quality than to rush a poor product.

We are excited to announce that we have just released a massive patch for our beloved MMORPG. This patch contains so many changes that we can&rsquo;t even list them all here. Seriously, it would take us hours to write down everything we have done to improve your gaming experience. Some of the changes are big, some are small, some are obvious, some are subtle, some are game-changing, some are cosmetic, some are bug fixes, some are new features, some are balance tweaks, some are quality of life improvements, some are surprises, some are secrets, and some are&hellip; well, you&rsquo;ll have to find out for yourself.

Class Changes Brawler Growing Fury&rsquo;s Irregular Optimization NEW: Increases damage from behind by 10% and overall damage by 69.7%. OLD: Increases damage from behind by 10% and overall damage by 73%. Design Note: This change will result in a 1.5% damage nerf when using Irregular Growing Fury.
Gunner [PvE] Fixed a bug which caused the class to deal much more damage than intended. Reaper Fixed a bug where Shadow Reaping could not be dispelled with Regression or Plague of Exhaustion.

Adjusted the Novice Dungeon Mission icons to help players to easily distinguish between Novice and Expert missions in their inventory. Combining [Battle Pass] Battleground Token with their respective mission now correctly gives Menma&rsquo;s PvP Hero Fragments.

Future Plans While this patch cycle and its dungeons are coming to a close, the entire team is hard at work on a big content patch. We promise that this upcoming patch is bigger and better than anything we&rsquo;ve done before, and includes major changes for both PvE and PvP. Additionally, we even hope to include proper translations in full for French and German. The entire team is incredibly excited, and we can&rsquo;t wait to share more information with you.

          PvP Overview We&rsquo;re aware of and have been listening closely to the community&rsquo;s concerns centered around the overall state of PvP balancing. As stated before, we&rsquo;re going to be doing continual changes over a long period. Our immediate goal was to foster the community back to life to get games popping and make the content playable before sinking our teeth deep into balancing. We&rsquo;re aware that our work has just begun, and we understand that we&rsquo;re nowhere near ready to relax yet.

          This time around, we&rsquo;ve been focusing a lot of our time on PvP. We&rsquo;ve snuck in some PvE changes here and there, but those interested in PvE should stay tuned for patches in the next couple of weeks.
Many of the changes are our first steps toward balancing many different aspects of PvP in Menma&rsquo;s TERA. We continue to ask for your patience while we do so, as balancing every part of the game in one patch is not possible.

A number of dungeons in the current PVE roster, ranging from entry-level dungeons to dungeons of the highest difficulty, have been reworked to not only bring boss HP values in-line with the balancing of classes that come with Patch 1.4, but should also make content that may previously have been a burden, more enjoyable to run. Naturally, these adjustments are subject to change, so we&rsquo;ll be reviewing the state of content and learning from your feedback in the coming weeks.

      <p>Adventurers, a new patch is coming!</p>
<h4 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h4>
<p>While this patch cycle and its dungeons are coming to a close, the entire team is hard at work on a big content patch. We promise that this upcoming patch is bigger and better than anything we&rsquo;ve done before, and includes major changes for both PvE and PvP. <br>
Additionally, we even hope to include proper translations in full for French and German. The entire team is incredibly excited, and we can&rsquo;t wait to share more information with you.</p>
<p>To give a bit of a sneak peek, for PvE players you can expect to get an all new set of gear to work towards, with new unlocks to farm for! With new gear means a new dungeon rotation, so get ready to see some critically acclaimed dungeons make their return. <br>
We also have an <em>all-new</em> dungeon system planned which will keep even the most battle-tested adventurers on their toes. Last but not least, for those who are interested in PvP, we aim to release an all new set of OWPvP gear to add progression while drastically improving our battleground balance.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support!<br>
─ Hail (Community Manager)</p>
<h2 id="battle-pass-season-ii">Battle Pass: Season II</h2>
<h4 id="information">Information</h4>
<p>The highly anticipated Battle Pass is making a return for its second season! Players can now farm for Menma&rsquo;s Hero Tokens <em>(known as Hunter Tokens in Season I)</em> by participating in either PvE or PvP content. You can redeem your hard earned Hero Tokens for exclusive rewards such as eternal pets, new costumes, new innerwear, and much more! To learn more about this season of the Battle Pass and its rewards, head over to our Discord server and check out the event channel for more detailed information.</p>
<h2 id="dungeon-changes">Dungeon Changes</h2>
<h4 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h4>
<ul>
<li>Removed boss HP bar shakes when dealing damage.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-changes">Class Changes</h2>
<p>*Design Note: *<em>After our recent adjustments, we&rsquo;ve noticed that certain classes outperform our expectations with specific tank matchups. However on the other hand, some classes struggle significantly when paired with a specific tank. With this patch we&rsquo;ve addressed these issues, and the respective classes were adjusted accordingly. On top of fixing these issues we also improved the consistency of most skill advancements, which increases class damage consistency rather than outright increasing their damage dealt.</em></p>
<p><em>We&rsquo;ve also been paying close attention to Mystic after our recent changes, as promised. There has been a lot of player feedback surrounding Mystic, and we&rsquo;re grateful that our changes have gotten the community to discuss their opinions more openly. This patch has changes to Mystic which will change its skill priority, returning some much needed variance to their rotation which was heavily requested based on your feedback. Lastly, we&rsquo;ve squeezed in a much needed buff to warrior tank which will bring it up to par with Brawler and Lancer.</em></p>
