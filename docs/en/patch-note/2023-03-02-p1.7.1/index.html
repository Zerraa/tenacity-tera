We know many of you are interested in our upcoming big patch, which we teased briefly in Patch 1.8. The entire team is working hard to make it the best it can be, but we&rsquo;re not ready to share more details yet. If you want to refresh your memory on what we&rsquo;ve revealed this far, you can follow the previous link.

PvE As for our upcoming content, we&rsquo;ve been hard at work and hope to have more solid previews soon. As previously mentioned, this is our largest patch to date and we want to make it as good as we can; only showing previews when we can guarantee its quality. We understand that some of you may feel burnt out with our current content, but our stance on this for now is that we&rsquo;d rather take our time to assure quality than to rush a poor product.

We are excited to announce that we have just released a massive patch for our beloved MMORPG. This patch contains so many changes that we can&rsquo;t even list them all here. Seriously, it would take us hours to write down everything we have done to improve your gaming experience. Some of the changes are big, some are small, some are obvious, some are subtle, some are game-changing, some are cosmetic, some are bug fixes, some are new features, some are balance tweaks, some are quality of life improvements, some are surprises, some are secrets, and some are&hellip; well, you&rsquo;ll have to find out for yourself.

Class Changes Brawler Growing Fury&rsquo;s Irregular Optimization NEW: Increases damage from behind by 10% and overall damage by 69.7%. OLD: Increases damage from behind by 10% and overall damage by 73%. Design Note: This change will result in a 1.5% damage nerf when using Irregular Growing Fury.
Gunner [PvE] Fixed a bug which caused the class to deal much more damage than intended. Reaper Fixed a bug where Shadow Reaping could not be dispelled with Regression or Plague of Exhaustion.

Future Plans While this patch cycle and its dungeons are coming to a close, the entire team is hard at work on a big content patch. We promise that this upcoming patch is bigger and better than anything we&rsquo;ve done before, and includes major changes for both PvE and PvP. Additionally, we even hope to include proper translations in full for French and German. The entire team is incredibly excited, and we can&rsquo;t wait to share more information with you.

          PvP Overview We&rsquo;re aware of and have been listening closely to the community&rsquo;s concerns centered around the overall state of PvP balancing. As stated before, we&rsquo;re going to be doing continual changes over a long period. Our immediate goal was to foster the community back to life to get games popping and make the content playable before sinking our teeth deep into balancing. We&rsquo;re aware that our work has just begun, and we understand that we&rsquo;re nowhere near ready to relax yet.

          This time around, we&rsquo;ve been focusing a lot of our time on PvP. We&rsquo;ve snuck in some PvE changes here and there, but those interested in PvE should stay tuned for patches in the next couple of weeks.
Many of the changes are our first steps toward balancing many different aspects of PvP in Menma&rsquo;s TERA. We continue to ask for your patience while we do so, as balancing every part of the game in one patch is not possible.

A number of dungeons in the current PVE roster, ranging from entry-level dungeons to dungeons of the highest difficulty, have been reworked to not only bring boss HP values in-line with the balancing of classes that come with Patch 1.4, but should also make content that may previously have been a burden, more enjoyable to run. Naturally, these adjustments are subject to change, so we&rsquo;ll be reviewing the state of content and learning from your feedback in the coming weeks.

      <h4 id="pvp-overview">PvP Overview</h4>
<p>We&rsquo;re aware of and have been listening closely to the community&rsquo;s concerns centered around the overall state of PvP balancing. As stated before, we&rsquo;re going to be doing continual changes over a long period. Our immediate goal was to foster the community back to life to get games popping and make the content <em>playable</em> before sinking our teeth deep into balancing. We&rsquo;re aware that our work has just begun, and we understand that we&rsquo;re nowhere near ready to relax yet. We will continue making changes to PvP often to ensure we get closer to the state we all want PvP to be in, one step at a time. Thank you to those who have given us your assistance: your feedback, support and time are all greatly appreciated. We will continue to do our best to serve you.</p>
<h4 id="pve-overview">PvE Overview</h4>
<p>This patch contains some changes to The Plexus (Hard), which is something that many of you expressed negative feelings towards. On the Discord, we spoke about implementing a form of &ldquo;off-season&rdquo; where we can make class changes more freely, without being worried about ensuring the competitive viability of that season is unharmed. The majority of the changes in this patch are balance changes: tying up loose ends while we implement the community&rsquo;s feedback surrounding Mystic. As always, we&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on these classes as we always have. We have expected performance metrics, and every class is intended to be as close to our metrics as possible. We&rsquo;ll tweak classes as necessary until we&rsquo;re happy with the results.</p>

<h2 id="dungeon-changes">Dungeon Changes</h2>
<h4 id="the-plexus-hard">The Plexus (Hard)</h4>
<p><em>Design Note:</em>* We&rsquo;ve been listening to your concerns recently regarding The Plexus (Hard), and its enjoyment (or lack thereof). A common point of contention was that the fight was simply dragged out to the point of not being enjoyable, with a single mistake during the stand mechanic or an unfortunate attack pattern in the last 8% ruining the taste of an otherwise decent fight. These changes should alleviate some of the concerns that have been brought up, and we hope it makes The Plexus (Hard) a more enjoyable experience again. To those concerned that we&rsquo;re making the &ldquo;penultimate hard content&rdquo; too easy, don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;ve got some hard content in the pipeline for you. Stay tuned!*</p>
<ul>
<li>Reworked Nightmare Shandra Manaya&rsquo;s AI, which should improve the flow of the fight.</li>
<li>Reduced Nightmare Shandra Manaya&rsquo;s HP to 55B (was 71B).</li>
<li>Changed the wipe timer to 7:00.</li>
<li>Moved the fast kill achievement to 5:00.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="removed-dungeons">Removed Dungeons</h4>
<p>The following dungeons have closed their doors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manglemire</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="class-changes">Class Changes</h2>
<h4 id="all-classes">All Classes</h4>
<ul>
<li>All mount crit power passives now only trigger within 55 seconds after any of the following skills are cast:
<ul>
<li>Archer&rsquo;s Windsong</li>
<li>Berserker&rsquo;s Bloodlust and Unleash</li>
<li>Brawler&rsquo;s Rhythmic Blows</li>
<li>Gunner&rsquo;s Modular Weapon System</li>
<li>Lancer&rsquo;s Adrenaline Rush</li>
<li>Mystic&rsquo;s Thrall of Wrath</li>
<li>Ninja&rsquo;s Inner Harmony or Fire Avalanche</li>
<li>Priest&rsquo;s Edict of Judgment</li>
<li>Reaper&rsquo;s Shadow Reaping</li>
<li>Slayer&rsquo;s In Cold Blood</li>
<li>Sorcerer&rsquo;s Mana Boost</li>
<li>Valkyrie&rsquo;s Godsfall or Ragnarok</li>
<li>Warrior&rsquo;s Deadly Gamble</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="archer">Archer</h4>
<ul>
<li>Increased Bow&rsquo;s Attack Modifier to 65,620 (was 64,507).</li>
<li>Fixed Windsong&rsquo;s tooltip to state it gives 10% Movement Speed.
<ul>
<li>Previously it stated 10% Attack Speed which was not true.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="brawler">Brawler</h4>
<p>*Design Note: *<em>While we&rsquo;re quite happy with the state of Brawler, it requires some tweaks, most notably with Brawler DPS. When adding up Counter&rsquo;s block absorption, Roundhouse Kick&rsquo;s Glyph of Grounding and the raw endurance that Brawler carries over as a tank, the survivability proved to be far too strong with the amount of raw damage the class could deal. The changes made in this patch will bring the class closer in line to Berserker as a damage dealer, where you can and should block, but you aren&rsquo;t just a tank hitting the boss from behind. It&rsquo;s not all bad for Brawler players though, as we&rsquo;ve squeezed in some quality-of-life changes which will improve multiple aspects of Brawler&rsquo;s play. Mounting Rage applying the Glyph of Swift from Punch will improve Brawler&rsquo;s opening phase; reducing the RNG involved in using Punch until the glyph activates. Additionally, the changes to Counter&rsquo;s Glyph of Powerlink will greatly improve damage consistency related to the glyph at the cost of reducing damage potential. Last but not least, we&rsquo;ll continue keeping an eye on how this class performs with these changes and make adjustments accordingly.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Counter
<ul>
<li>While Growing Fury (Irregular) is active, the maximum damage that can be blocked is reduced to 53,015.</li>
<li>Glyph of Powerlink now has a 100% chance to apply the following buff:
<ul>
<li>Tank: Increases all skill damage by 17.5% for 6 seconds.</li>
<li>DPS: Increases all skill damage by 5% for 18 seconds.
<ul>
<li>The previous effect had a 60% chance to increase all skill damage by 25% for 6 seconds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Divine Wrath
<ul>
<li>[PvP] Can no longer be used in Corsairs&rsquo; Stronghold (15v15).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Roundhouse Kick
<ul>
<li>Glyph of Grounding no longer activates while Growing Fury (Irregular) is active.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Growing Fury (Irregular)
<ul>
<li>While active, reduces Endurance by 90.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mounting Rage
<ul>
<li>Now triggers Glyph of Swift when cast.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="gunner">Gunner</h4>
<p>*Design Note: *<em>It&rsquo;s no secret that Gunners have been struggling to utilize the additional Cooldown Reduction provided by Lancer&rsquo;s recent rework. This is in large part due to Gunner&rsquo;s skills having a fixed attack speed. These changes will help alleviate some of Gunner player&rsquo;s main concerns while playing with a Lancer.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the CDR/DMG breakdown when affected by a Lancer&rsquo;s Adrenaline Rush:
<ul>
<li>Reduced Final Cooldown Reduction to 7.5% (was 15%).</li>
<li>Increased skill damage by an additional 9.5%.
<ul>
<li>Note that this skill damage increase stacks with the change to Adrenaline Rush made this patch, for a grand total of 24% increased skill damage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="lancer">Lancer</h4>
<p><em>Design Note: We&rsquo;ve been keeping a close eye on Lancer with both its personal performance and how it affects party damage. Unfortunately, it has been underperforming our expectations especially compared to Brawler. These changes will help bring the class closer to our design metrics.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Adrenaline Rush
<ul>
<li>Increases skill damage by an additional 3.5% for all party members.</li>
<li>March Advancement
<ul>
<li>[PvP] Now increases PvP Damage by 10% (was 30%).</li>
<li>[PvP] No longer reduces incoming PvP Damage by 30%.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Onslaught
<ul>
<li>Impact EP has been reintroduced.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mystic">Mystic</h4>
<p><em>Design Note: Regarding your feedback, we&rsquo;ve began taking the first steps to implement the result of the poll. Mystic gives stronger buffs in exchange for less damage dealt by the Mystic player themselves. We also rebalanced some damage back to Thrall of Wrath, as the more passive damage play style seemed to be more enjoyable for the majority of the Mystic players. Finally, we made Metamorphic Blast and Metamorphic Smite more viable to help fill the awkward downtime that Mystics experienced after our Arunic Release changes. Try these changes and let us know how you feel in the Mystic feedback discussion forum!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Arunic Release
<ul>
<li>Reduced skill damage by 66%.</li>

<ul>
<li>Thrall buff increases Power by 20 and [PvE] Normal Crit Power by 0.45 (was 0.71).</li>
<li>Increased thrall damage by 50%.</li>
<li>Should no longer die in any circumstance.</li>
<li>[PvP] Can now be used in Champion&rsquo;s Skyring.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Warding Totem
<ul>
<li>Should no longer die in any circumstance.</li>

<ul>
<li>Increased damage absorption to 70,000 (was 39,749).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="reaper">Reaper</h4>
<p>*Design Note: *<em>Reaper has been vastly outperforming our design metrics, and this will bring them back in line with our expectations.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Sundering Strike
<ul>
<li>[PvE] Reduced damage dealt by 17.5%.</li>
</ul>

<li>Increased the iframe duration to improve chaining multiple Evasive Rolls together.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="warrior">Warrior</h4>
<p><em>Design Note: We&rsquo;ve noticed that Warriors have been struggling to sync properly after the first burn, due to needing to stack Traverse Cut and edge before popping Deadly Gamble. The changes made to Deadly Gamble should make the class a bit more forgiving.</em></p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Reduced base Cooldown to 115 seconds (was 120s).</li>

<h4 id="corsairs-stronghold-15v15">Corsairs&rsquo; Stronghold (15v15)</h4>
<p>*Design Note: *<em>The change made to disable defensive and movement skills at spawn will reduce the possibility of accidentally (or intentionally) phasing through the gates before the Battleground match has begun. Shore Hold has also received this change for the same reason. As always, we do not condone this type of exploitation, and we will continue to moderate against it.</em></p>
