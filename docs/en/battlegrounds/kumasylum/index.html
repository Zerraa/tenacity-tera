          The purpose of this thread is in a way to compress things which you learn in arena with a lot of experience and time and to explain them to the newer players so they can improve faster by understanding how the pvp actually works much quicker than others. Hopefully after reading this thread more people will improve in pvp faster than they would normally and we&rsquo;ll get more arena in which people are going to play their classes to the maximum.

If someone takes a Candy, you are alerted and it is your duty to chase down and kill the player carrying the Candy (the &lsquo;<strong>carrier</strong>&rsquo;).</p>
<p>There are 2 types of Kuma - <strong>Baby</strong> and <strong>Mama</strong>/Red (proper name is Nanny).</p>
<p>Once you have killed a carrier, the Candy will be in your possession. Be careful now, since the enemy must now kill you to obtain that Candy. It is recommendable to stay in close vicinity to the Red kuma since it has a heal ability.</p>
<p><strong>If you are still in possession of at least 2 candies when the game ends, you win.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Red kumas can heal other kumas AND CHESTS!</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t loiter near the correct chests. Hang around a random chest as a decoy, but watch the HP of the real chests (click them).</li>
<li>If you kill a Candy carrier whilst you are in possession of a Candy already, it will drop on the floor.</li>
<li>Red kumas are the most powerful, hence there is only 1 of them.</li>
<li>If people are blocking you with their mounts, you can use Leap (3) or Roll (4) to pass them.</li>
<li>Stun Ball (1) has a long distance and is very useful.</li>
<li>If 2 kumas are attempting to kill one carrier, one focus on the healers whilst the other focuses on the carrier. That way, the carrier will die a lot faster.</li>
</ul>

<p>How wonderful, you are matched to the Federation team. Good luck.</p>
<p>Just kidding, a good Federation team can easily win Kumasylum. Refer to this image for the 5 patterns of Candy locations. They will 95% be in these locations, there are rare occasions (possibly bugs) where the Candy is in a different location.</p>
<ul>
<li>Carriers should research the shortcut locations on the map.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Carriers should also be prepared to log out or close client when in danger.</strong> It is unclear whether this is bug abuse or not, feel free to remove this section if it is.</p>

<p>This image is a great, <strong>guaranteed way to find the pattern</strong> of candies quickly. <br>
The aim is to find the highlighted (red circle) chest, following the &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;No&rsquo; arrows depending on if the chest is present. You do not need to break the chest, only check if it is present. This should take a minute or 2 at most, giving you at least 13 minutes to break the chests and deliver 2 candies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be handy to print this image off until you are familiar with it, knowing this will boost your chances of winning quite a bit.</p>

<ul>
<li>Berserker&rsquo;s Thunderstrike does not knock down Kumas.</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Healers note two things - Firstly, always follow the carrier.</strong> They need CONSTANT HEALING. Priests use Kaia&rsquo;s Shield when possible.<br>
Secondly, Priests should rebuff Blessing of Zenobia, Seren and Balder, Mystics should be using Aura of the Swift and Thrall of Protection Endurance glyph (if possible).</p>
<p>If you are not the carrier, you should <strong>escort the carrier to the ships</strong> in the top left or top right of the map. Use your PvE knockdown skills to <strong>knock the Kumas down</strong> and buy some time to run away. <strong>Such skills include but are not limited to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slayer&rsquo;s Knockdown Strike</li>
<li>Warrior&rsquo;s Rising Fury and Rain of Blows</li>
<li>Berserker&rsquo;s Flatten</li>
<li>Archer&rsquo;s Radiant Arrow</li>
<li>Reapers Sundering Strike</li>
<li>Lancer&rsquo;s Wallop</li>
<li>Brawler&rsquo;s Haymaker</li>
</ul>
<p>If you see that a <strong>Kuma is slept, don&rsquo;t hit it</strong>. Sleep will take a Kuma out of the game for 20 seconds and is hard to successfully apply.</p>
<p>Lancers and d-stance warriors can stay between kuma and carrier and block some attacks to reduce the damage.</p>
<p><strong>If the Candy falls into Kuma possession near the Ships, it is advisable to kill it</strong> as soon as possible. Mystics should spawn Thrall of Wrath, while warriors attempt to apply as many Traverse Cuts as possible.</p>
<p>Priest&rsquo;s should also use Glyph of Enfeeblement on Triple Nemesis. Attempt to hit the Kuma when there is no one in dire need of a heal (or pop Kaia&rsquo;s Shield and quickly get a hit or 2 off before returning to healing).</p>
<p><strong>If you successfully steal 2 candies, you have won the game.</strong> If you do not get the last one, the game will carry on as normal until the end, but you still win.</p>

<li>there is a chest at 1 ? <strong>Take the Route B</strong> .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now u need to check if ther is a chest at 2 and 3 :
