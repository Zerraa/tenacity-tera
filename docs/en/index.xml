      <description>If you access the Korean servers by 30th June, you can play Last Quest, created by the BHS as a final Goodbye before the live servers officially shut down.
It was confirmed that Gameforge (EU,NA,SEA publisher) will NOT be releasing this questline themself. As of writing, they only released translated cutscene from last part of the series of quests.
But honestly, their translated version is as cheap as it can get&amp;hellip;</description>

If there would be volunteers to translate into other languages;for example German or Spanish I wont be against adding those as well.
That being said Im also looking for translators who would help our translating the content of the website, contact me on Discord if youre interested 👋</description>

DPS - A large majority of the mobs in this dungeon cannot be stunned or slept, and can only be slowed.
 Since they will be making a beeline for the crystals in the center of each platform, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to delay them for as long as possible so that you have time to kill them.</description>

      <description>A crit cap or crit-factor cap is the point at which having any more crit factor is a detriment to your DPS potential.
What Factors Influence the Crit Cap?  Boss Level versus Your Level  The difference between the target and your level will adjust how much crit factor is needed for your skills to crit.
It might be an impact on how much crit resist the boss has but the important part is the higher you are relative to the target, the lower amount of crit factor you need.</description>
