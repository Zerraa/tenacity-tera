      <description>Adventurers, a new patch is coming!
PvE As for our upcoming content, we&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work and hope to have more solid previews soon. As previously mentioned, this is our largest patch to date and we want to make it as good as we can; only showing previews when we can guarantee its quality. We understand that some of you may feel burnt out with our current content, but our stance on this for now is that we&amp;rsquo;d rather take our time to assure quality than to rush a poor product.</description>

      <description>PvP Overview We&amp;rsquo;re aware of and have been listening closely to the community&amp;rsquo;s concerns centered around the overall state of PvP balancing. As stated before, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be doing continual changes over a long period. Our immediate goal was to foster the community back to life to get games popping and make the content playable before sinking our teeth deep into balancing. We&amp;rsquo;re aware that our work has just begun, and we understand that we&amp;rsquo;re nowhere near ready to relax yet.</description>

      <description>This time around, we&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing a lot of our time on PvP. We&amp;rsquo;ve snuck in some PvE changes here and there, but those interested in PvE should stay tuned for patches in the next couple of weeks.
Many of the changes are our first steps toward balancing many different aspects of PvP in MT The Dream. We continue to ask for your patience while we do so, as balancing every part of the game in one patch is not possible.</description>

This is the first time since we have joined the team that we&amp;rsquo;ve been making such large notable changes for both PvE and PvP simultaneously.
PvE We have received a lot of valuable feedback, with a common trend of feeling tired of our current lineup.</description>

A number of dungeons in the current PVE roster, ranging from entry-level dungeons to dungeons of the highest difficulty, have been reworked to not only bring boss HP values in-line with the balancing of classes that come with Patch 1.4, but should also make content that may previously have been a burden, more enjoyable to run. Naturally, these adjustments are subject to change, so we&amp;rsquo;ll be reviewing the state of content and learning from your feedback in the coming weeks.</description>

Finding videos of P1 is a bit tricky since most people who regularly clear P2 would consider P1 kinda pointless.</description>

      <description>A crit cap or crit-factor cap is the point at which having any more crit factor is a detriment to your DPS potential.
What Factors Influence the Crit Cap? Boss Level versus Your Level The difference between the target and your level will adjust how much crit factor is needed for your skills to crit.
It might be an impact on how much crit resist the boss has but the important part is the higher you are relative to the target, the lower amount of crit factor you need.</description>
