      <guid>https://zera-dev.github.io/tenacity-tera.github.io/en/menma-guide/class-crit-cap/</guid>
      <description>A crit cap or crit-factor cap is the point at which having any more crit factor is a detriment to your DPS potential.
What Factors Influence the Crit Cap?  Boss Level versus Your Level  The difference between the target and your level will adjust how much crit factor is needed for your skills to crit.
It might be an impact on how much crit resist the boss has but the important part is the higher you are relative to the target, the lower amount of crit factor you need.</description>
