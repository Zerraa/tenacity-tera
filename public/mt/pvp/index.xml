      <description>Server operates in UTC timezone. Please keep it in mind and act accordingly. Main difference you will notice is that map is different. As of p2.0 Civil Unrest is being held on Colossal Ruins map.
You can also freely use Prime battle solution inside the area. Towers can only be placed 100 meters apart from each other. Spots only reachable by climbing are blocked off and if tower is still placed on such spots its destroyed when Civil Unrest starts.</description>

      <description>Server operates in UTC timezone. Please keep it in mind and act accordingly. All Guilds can accept [Rally] Guild Quest as long as weekly Valderon Token limit has not been reached. Rally Quest can be completed regardless of the amount of contribution as long as a Guild Member has contributed.
Menma&amp;rsquo;s Tera changed Rally BAMs significantly with Patch 2.0. There are now PvP, PvE and General Rally BAMs - all giving their unique rewards.</description>
