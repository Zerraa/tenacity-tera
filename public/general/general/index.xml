MT: The Dream Dreamstorm Lag Issues #Similar to Nexus or Dreamstorm, large number of players concentrated in a small area exposed the 32bit client&amp;rsquo;s inability to handle the overload of network packets and graphically rendering actions of over a hundred players, leading to client freezing until the surge of information decreased or disconnecting from the server.</description>
