Nothing special, kill them and move to the first boss.\nFirst Boss: Thalweg Basic attacks Slap - Simple two hit attack.\nSlam - Simple two hit attack.\nRandom Target Laser - Basically, a random target will get the purple secondary aggro circle, the boss will turn to face him, and then he will shoot a beam of laser.\nThe laser is lock on and will follow the target until shot. This move can kill your healers or your sorcs so have them practice timing their iframe carefully. Forward Roll / Side Roll - \u0026ldquo;Forward Roll\u0026rdquo; always happens after his eyes light up.\nIt’s also a great way for the boss to push you against the wall making it easier for you to position him in a way that pleases everyone. The “Side Roll” is indicated by him swinging his left hand outwards.\nThen he will turn sideways and roll. He will often follow this roll by another roll going in the opposite direction. According to some guides on KTera forums, the first roll can also be followed by laser or a forward roll. Ground Waves - The boss will growl while moving his head in a growling motion followed by 4 waves of blue AoE attack all around the boss.\nHits stagger and knock you down. Kaiable/iframable. Special attacks I will get stronger - The boss will growl while moving his head in a growling motion much like what he does during “Growling Waves” attack, except he will have a speech bubble that says :\nI.. I will get stronger!\rNow, while getting him get stronger might make this boss much more thriling, it wouldnt make it easier.\nSo in order to prevent him from getting stronger, you must stun him before he gets his stack of power buff.\nOnce you successfully stun him, he will flop to the ground. This is neither a timed pattern nor a pattern based on health percentage. In fact, it can even happen consecutively so always be prepared and always be ready. Virus adds - This occurs first when the boss reaches 16 lines of HP. Then it is hypothesized that “Viral Zone” will occur every 2:30 minute after the first.\nThese viruses will spawn as well as a large fiery zone that much resembles hell. You can see a glimpse of it in the “Laser” move gif. What you want to do in this situation is you want the healer to heal aggro the viruses into this fiery zone of hell where the DPS will help get rid of these viruses.\nSpider Spawns - These happens every 2 minute interval of the fight. The boss will finish whatever he was doing and then quickly shuffle his way to the center.\nThen there will be 4 different mobs that spawn in different corners of this circular room and approach the boss. If the mobs get to the center safely, then the boss will obtain a stack of power buff for every non-killed mob. Bomber Unit - Once your party brings the boss down to 8 lines of HP, a bomber will spawn every minute.\nAt the same time a random member in your party will get a slow debuff. Bridge You will meet several mobs spawning along the way, you will have to kill them before attacking the miniboss at the end.\nMiniboss generally doesnt require much dps, just kill him and move on to the last boss.\nTip: You can skip killing the mobs if your party jumps on to the railing on the side of the stairs near the miniboss. The mobs will lose aggro and disappear, allowing you to instantly start fighting the miniboss.\nLast Boss: Krakatox Basic attacks Forward Attack (x2/x4) - Takes a bone out from his body and swings 2 or 4 times while moving forward.\nSafe Zone: Behind his right leg (bony leg) Note: May walk into a virus zone reducing DPS or walk out of the room causing the boss to reset.\nWide Attack - Takes a bone out and swings in a wide arc.\nIt hits 315 degrees with a 15m radius. This is the most dangerous attack pattern especially since it is followed by a laser attack. Safe Zone: Behind his right leg (bony leg) Special attacks Laser - This move usually comes after the double wide attack.\nThis attack has 3 characteristics:\nFan shaped attack 2x more damage at ranged players Applies “Democron’s Virus” debuff The Democron’s Virus debuff from the laser inflicts continuous damage every 2 seconds for 20 seconds.\nBomb + Ground Stab - He digs out 1 or 3 bombs from his belly and throws it away from him.\nIf he throws three bombs, the areas where the explosions intersect will cause double the damage. Furthermore this attack is immediately followed by a Ground Stab which is a melee AoE attack that will cause players to be knocked down. The Ground stab attack hits 15m around the point where the weapon hits the ground. If you’re facing the front of the boss, the area of effect will be up to 18m away from the boss.\nBleeding Attack + Ground Stab - Normally a purple circle without attack animation indicates Bleeding Attack.\nHe will stab the ground with his hand causing a spike to come up inflicting a \u0026ldquo;Democron’s Virus\u0026rdquo; debuff on the player. Then he will stab the ground with a bone causing an AoE KD. Shield Phase (AKA Democron’s Energy) - It will begin as the boss stops his attacks and walk towards the center of the room.\nThis is the best opportunity for the DPS to get as much DPS in as possible. There are three different aspects to this phase. The first aspect is the actual shield. The shield will absorb all damage and needs to be broken within 15 seconds. If it is not broken, the party will wipe. The second aspect is the Blue Tentacles that appear during every shield phase. Your party can decide to break the tentacles or to not break it. Basically, a number of blue tentacles will appear at the beginning of shield phase and if you destroy all the tentacles, you will receive a buff called “Democron’s Cell”. This buff will protect you from the third aspect AKA the virus zone. The first shield phase (at Line 16) will only have 1 tentacle while the second shield phase and the third will have 3 and 5 tentacles. The third aspect is the Virus Zone. Similar to the Virus Zones in Stage 1, a virus zone that does continuous damage per second to all the players inside it. You may choose to clear the tentacles which will negate all the damage incurred by the virus zone or you may choose to heal spam through the damage and go straight to attacking the boss. Democron’s Curse - Onscreen message will appear indicating the start of Democron’s Curse. The curse will stack every 10 seconds.\nTentacle Prison - A random player is caught in a tentacle prison which needs to be broken within 18 seconds.\nIf you fail to break the prison within 18 seconds, your entire party will wipe. This pattern is avoidable by evading just before the prison appears. There are several examples in the youtube video above. Occurse every 40 ~ 45 seconds. Charge and Evolution - Very similar to Shandra Manaya’s “Great Ones lend me your power” pattern.\nFirst, an on-screen message will appear saying “Put up with this!” and will start charging. He will CHARGE for 5 seconds and if you fail to stop his charge, he will EVOLVE. To stop the charge the healer needs to use Plague of Exhaustion or Regression on the boss before he finishes charging. Once he evolves, his attack speed will increase by 10% and power by 100% for 30 seconds.\nOnce you hit line 4 of his HP bar, the last shield phase will occur (with 5 tentacles) marking the start of stage 4.\nAt this time, your curse debuff will stop stacking and the boss will start getting an ENRAGE buff. It will stack every 5 seconds and increase the boss’s power with every stack. By the time shield phase is over he will already have 5 stacks. From around 20 stacks, players will not be able to block any of his attack. The trick in Stage 4 is to make sure you do not cleanse the existing Curse debuff to ensure you have enough DPS to clear the boss as fast as possible.\nSources EDCTera 1st Boss EDCTera 2nd Boss "},"title":"Abscess"},"/dungeon-guide/dungeon/akalath-quarantine/":{"data":{"":"","first-boss-akalath-travan#First Boss: Akalath Travan":"","second-boss-akalath-kashir#Second Boss: Akalath Kashir":"","sources#Sources":"\rFirst Boss: Akalath Travan Key Mechanics Color Mechanic - This mechanic is the same as in Ruinous Manor (Hard), oneshotting you if you fail or your debuff times out.\nMechanic starts when the boss says :\nBear my curse!\rAnd draws his swords away from his body.\nWhenever he uses this mechanic, it will create a pulse of energy debuff on the players. Changing or giving them a new color if they have none.\nPay attention to your debuff! You will die after getting 2 stacks of the same color or the duration expires.\nThere are only two variations of this attack. Same as in Ruinous Manor (Hard).\nIf the color thats being gathered near boss is blue -\u0026gt; Blue will be IN, Red OUT If the color thats being gathered near boss is red -\u0026gt; Red will be IN, Blue OUT You can watch boss\u0026rsquo;s feet for the color, or swords that he draws out. Both become colored by the color that will appear inside.\nAlways remember to take the opposite of the color that you have. HEALERS Keep everyone healed up. When you are hit by new color, it will still hit you for significant amount of HP. Begone - The boss will say :\nBegone!\rAnd puts his hands together gathering energy.\nAttack range of this mechanic is 20meters around the boss. Keep your distance from Travan to avoid it. Impossible to block, impossible to iframe. You can skip running away from this mechanic will lancers protection skills or healers kaia skills.

Bleeding can be cleansed Under 50% he will follow up with a second scratch on the right side.\nRight,Right,Back turn,Sword slam into Rear - This attack is very dangerous if you are damaging the boss from the side. The rear hit will most likely oneshot you if you are low on HP.\nMake sure to iframe the rear hit. Sword hit on the back is easily avoidable. Dps who are attacking from behind and are very close to the boss will not take any damage. If the aggro changes to be behind boss, the boss will do only rear attack behind him before turning. Right,Right,Back turn,Sword into Slam - Same attack as above, the only difference is that the rear attack will not happen and instead the boss will slam his swords into the ground after he turns back.\nDown slam with swords is not blockable and must be iframed Stuns when hit. Stun is cleansable. 4 Scratches - Boss gives out secondary aggro 4 times in a row to random players.\nEach time the boss will proceed to swipe in the direction of secondary aggro. Best is to not move so much, so the boss doesnt turn to all sides and swipe everywhere. Cannot be iframed. Bleeding can be cleansed Circle AOE into Spin - Most likely the deadliest attack apart for the color mechanic.\nThe boss will create and aoe on the ground under every member of the party. When the AoEs stay on the ground, iframe. If you fail to iframe, you will be stunned. Stun is cleansable Right after the AoEs hit, boss will spin. Killing everyone in his near proximity if they are stunned. Spin is unlockable (blue shield can be used), can be iframed. Sometimes the boss can also only spin without doing AoE bombs.\nYou can see the spin coming as he puts his hands on the ground and \u0026ldquo;stretches\u0026rdquo; his hands out before spinning. Second Boss: Akalath Kashir Key Mechanics Bleed debuff (red) - Several of Kashir attacks apply a bleed debuff if you get hit.\nCan be cleansed. Bleed debuff (purple) - You will periodically get this bleed debuff.\nCan be cleansed. Permanent bleed debuff - Once you let the previous debuff stack to 5 times it will turn into a permanent one.\nCANNOT BE CLEANSED Phantom Kashir - A message will appear :\nAkalath Kashir aims for your back.\rAnd Kashir will roar.\nThats your cue to spread.

Back roll into wave - Boss jumps back, avoiding all damage. Instead of a dash he will summon 3 clones which will spawn a wave towards each other.\nStomp, Scratch - Kashir quickly stomps to the target and scratches.\nThere is a high chance of being down when hit with the left foot. Bleeding when hit by scratch, cannot be cleansed, cannot be blocked, can be iframed. When attacking a random player, Kashir can cast same attack once more.\nRessbait - Basic mechanic when ressbaiting. Kashir will target you with a teleport into a quick scratch.\nHe will teleport back to the aggro and scratch on tank as well. Bleeding when hit by scratch, cannot be cleansed, cannot be blocked, can be iframed. Jump - Kashir charges up, jumping in the air.\nAs he lands, he will deal big damage players in close and far-field area. Either move out 20meters and after inner-zone hits, move inside to avoid the outer-zone hit. Lancer can use their protection skills. Healer should kaia Impossible to block. Impossible to iframe.

Claw attacks can be frontal, or to the side. He can even swipe from above.\nAll players hit will receive a Bleeding Effect. Darumag can also stomp (slamming the ground with both claws) or leap (jumping at a player and causing damage). Both attacks will apply a Bleeding Effect. Special attacks Battle Cry - Darumag’s eyes will flash red and will deal deadly damage in form a shockwave from his chest.\nStagger - Darumag will fall back before jumping forward, striking staggering attacks to those who get hit.\nPlayers hit will receive a Bleeding Effect. Shield - At 85% and below, the boss will receive a shield effect and make his way towards the Hand of Akeron (inside the field).\nIf players fail to break the shield, he’ll recieve an attack speed and power buff. Second Boss: Magnarox Key Mechanics Godbinder - This fight involves co-operation. Your team will need to split into 2 groups as this fight involves 2 battles. One team will be fighting the boss and the other team will be protecting the Godbinder (the big sword) from a group of monsters.\nThe aim is to kill the boss before the mobs destroy the Godbinder. The raid must decide on who goes where, as the room will be split and divided after 30 seconds of starting the fight. A gate will spawn between the boss and the mobs/Godbinder, so act quickly. A Priest can pull players, however. The gate will disappear for a set duration at 80%, 60%, 40% and 20% of the bosses HP. If the Godbinder is damaged, then the boss will receive a beneficial boost. You can restore the HP of the Godbinder by killing certain monsters (Priest and Warrior) and standing inside their bodies as they die. You’ll receive a buff, which heals the the sword when you touch it. Special attacks Lava Projectiles - Similar to other molten turtles, this boss can spit out Lava Jets, Fireballs, and Eruptions infront of him.\nBe careful as these hurt. Slams and Spins - This boss has physical attacks as well, including Belly Flop (a frontal ground slam)\nSlides (boss will slide against the ground, causing damage and leaving behind an eruption) Trample (similar to Slides, he’ll charge at a player in attempt to trample them) Spin (the boss will spin and move around causing deadly damage to anyone close enough). Lava Ring - Deadly smoke will seep out of the sides of the boss, this is an indication that he will flood the area around him with deadly lava.\nBe sure to get out! Fire Ring - Magnarox will stand tall, exerting a dust cloud. He’ll then follow up with a ring of fire around him.\nBoth the dust and fire will inflict damage. Third Boss: Sammar-Sammal This boss is usually kept in the middle, due to AoE’s around it.\nKey Mechanics Energy Overload - During the fight, energy will rain down onto the field.\nYou must dodge all the red danger zones to avoid being hit. If hit, you’ll receive a fixed amount of damage, this may not kill you, but taking too many, or if your HP is too low, you will die. Basic attacks Snake Attacks - Sammar’s regular attacks will consist of it using it’s snakes. These are frontal damage attacks, it may use more than one to attack.\nSimilar to other hydraths, it may combo it’s snake attacks and deal more consistent and heavier attacks, be careful. Special attacks Shock Wave - During the fight, Sammar will rotate it’s body vertically (it’s bottom half will be on top), this indicates it’s next move, a shock wave.\nThe area around Sammar will be jolted with waves of energy, causing stagger and several tickers of damage to those who are caught. Inverted Energy - 30 seconds after the fight has begun, Sommar will wrap it’s snakes around itself, before releasing them and a veil of inverted energy.\nThis will cause players to receive an inverted debuff (their controls will be inverted) for 10 seconds. This cannot be cleansed and occurs every 45 seconds from the initial attack. Final Boss: Duras He will move around, like Fulminar from Bathysmal Rise, you may have to use similar tanking methods.\nKey Mechanics Melted Armor - Duras’s arm glow orange and he will strike. Players hit by this powerful punch will receive a harmful effect.\nPlayers’ weapon defense (block amount) will be reduced. This will occur after the second Stomp. If tanks receive three stacks of Melted Armor, blocking attacks will heavily drain Resolve. Pyrovores - Throughout the battle, these pyrovores will spawn announced by :\nℹ️ Pyrovores are approaching” They should be killed as soon as possible. If they make their way to the vents, they’ll receive an increase in defense, making them hard to kill. This becomes an issue as they occupy the vent spots, which are needed in the next mechanic: Lava Flow - When Duras is reaches: 80%, 60%, 40% and 20% HP, he’ll make his way to the centre of the field and plunge into the ground to unleash a wave of lava that spreads throughout the entire area. This is notified by :\nℹ️ Burn for me!” To survive this attack, you must make your way to one of the vents located on the outer edges. Standing on them will push you into the air, saving you from burning. Be aware, there is a limit for the amount of players per vent (3). Akeron\u0026rsquo;s Power - When Akeron shouts “Duras, I give you the gift of fire!“, Duras will be given an aura which deals damage over time to everyone within 20m.\nIf your heals are good and the party is evading damage as normal, you can heal through this. If you feel like you’re going to die, then you may exit the 20m zone. Circle of Fire - When Duras shouts :\nℹ️ You will all burn!” Duras will stomp the ground, sparking a fiery blaze of damage. This is static damage. Aura of Fire - When Duras shouts\nℹ️ The whole world will burn!” Duras will stomp the ground. He will gain an aura similar to Akeron’s Power, dealing damage over time to players nearby. There is no visual indicator for the area though. Duras’s Barrier - Akeron will command\nℹ️ Duras! Focus on (Player)!” He will have a shield which will need to be destroyed by dealing damage.\nHowever, Duras will focus on a player and attempt to stomp them to death with flat damage stomps whilst the shield is active. You cannot use iframes if you are the targetted player. It is recommended that healers constantly heal the player and the priest can use their pull if needed. The targeted player can constantly circle around Duras’s legs to avoid damage while the other party members attempt to destroy the shield. Basic attacks Slash - Duras will slash twice whilst moving forward, dealing deadly frontal damage.\nAkeron will turn towards the initial target before continuing with his second slash. Stomp - Duras will stomp twice, dealing AoE damage. Players hit will be pushed back. He will proceed to do Melted Armor.\nSpecial attacks Linear Smash - Duras will lock on to a player and proceed to aim a deadly ground attack which affects both frontal and behind.\nDuras will follow the player if they move until the eruption occurs. Other players may be hit. Circular Eruption - Duras will slam the ground with immense power, causing damage to the ground beneath him, or around.\nPlayers must watch out for the damage indicators to evade damage. Whip and Laser - Duras will lock onto a random player and proceed to lash them out with a stone whip.\nDuras can also aim a flame laser at a player, this will usually follow a stone whip and will require you to evade using an iframe. Bomb Melt - Duras compresses molten rock and then slams it against the ground. This inflicts deadly damage and leaves behind a molten field.\nPlayers who make contact with this molten field will receive ticks of damage.

When the mob HP is above 40%, the poison floor attack is usually targeted at a ranged DD or the healer. Below 40%, it will spam it on everyone.\nThis boss should be tanked at the 4 o\u0026rsquo;clock position of the room.\nWhen you are targeted for the poison floor move, you should move as far away as possible, wait for the poison floor to land, then come back and join the fight. If the tank is targeted by the move, just reposition slightly to move out of the poison floor and continue tanking.\nAlso, the poison floor move is almost always followed by a laser attack. Second Boss: Halveterak Overseer It\u0026rsquo;s not too difficult but the one-shot moves must be avoided.\nOne-shot move (we\u0026rsquo;ll just call it Death Missile for now) - The mob will fly straight up, flap its wings about 6 times, then come down like a missile on one target.\nIf hit, it will most likely one-shot everyone except the tank depending on DEF and buffs. Even if you survive, you will be hit with a -80% endurance debuff, so it is best to avoid it at all costs. There are 3 patterns of Death Missile.\nRandom party member is targeted with a red circle. That person is targeted by the Death Missile. Random party member is targeted with a red circle. Another random person is targeted by the Death Missile. No fucks are given. Death Missile is targeted at a random person. The red circle here works just like Kaprima\u0026rsquo;s targeted attack where the red circle tracks you for a few seconds then stops right before the actual attack goes off. You can avoid this red circle in the same manner by escaping the circle right when it stops moving.\nIf hit by this move, you will be hit with a 8 second debuff that disables all skills. There are three ways to avoid the actual Death Missile attack.\nFor classes that have an iframe dodge such as Death From Above, or Evasive Rolll, you can use the evasive skill at the right time to avoid the attack. You can also use dash/jaunt to move behind the mob at the right time to avoid the attack. Finally, you can also avoid the attack just by going very far out of range. Keep in mind that Death Missile will reach about 30m from his flight point, and the length of the room is only about 45-50m.\nThis means that the tank must tank it at one side of the room if you plan to be using the GTFO method to avoid Death Missile. How do you know who is being targeted by Death Missile? Well, look! The only way to tell the target of Death Missile is by looking upwards at the boss to see who HE is looking at. If he\u0026rsquo;s looking at you\u0026hellip; better run! The tank can also be targeted by Death Missile.\nThird Boss: Lokmar Sorgalur This fight is the real \u0026lsquo;Mental Breakdown\u0026rsquo; of Argon Corpus HM.\nThe boss is a stationary boss that does not move, unlike anything you have fought before in Tera.\nExcluding the one-shot move, his attacks also do not hurt that much for leather/plate classes. However, you should still avoid the attacks that leaves a bleeding effect. When you first enter the room, the lancer should go to the other side of the entrance and begin tanking so the DDs can attack from behind. From 100% to 80%, it\u0026rsquo;s just tank and spank.\nOnce the 80% mark is reached, observer mobs will spawn. These troll mobs will spawn a suicide bomber if it catches anyone within 8m.\nIf the suicide bomber is allowed to spawn, it will one shot anyone that is hit by it. The key to winning this fight is NOT allowing any suicide bombers to spawn. Melee DD will need to hug the boss at all times to avoid being within 8m of an observer.\nBackstab and evasive roll INTO the boss should be used to evade attacks. DPS should stop at 81%, and everyone needs to run inside and hug the boss.\nThe boss should then be pushed below 80% to force the observers to spawn. Now, take notice of the observers and the healer/ranged DDs need to run back out while avoiding the observers. With the entrance of the boss room being 6 o\u0026rsquo;clock, the 3 observers are spawned at 11, 1, and 2 o\u0026rsquo;clock positions.\nObserver 11 moves slowers than observers 1 and 2. Ranged DD and the healer will now be traveling between the observers as they move in a clockwise motion while keeping a safe distance. But the fun is just starting.\nWhen observers 1 and 2 eventualy catch up to observer 11, thereby sandwiching the healer/ranged DD, you will need to cut across through the boss to avoid suicide bomber pops. If you have been doing proper DPS, the boss should be reaching 30% HP on healer\u0026rsquo;s/ranged DD\u0026rsquo;s 2nd cut-across. When the boss\u0026rsquo;s HP drops below 30%, it will begin to do a massive dmg attack that basically one shots anyone hit by it.\nThus, all DPS should stop at 31%. Then, the tank and melee should spot the location of the healer/ranged DD and join them in the merry-go-round.\nOnce the 5man merry-go-round has begun, the ranged DD needs to push the boss below 30%. While keeping an eye on the location of the observers, hug the outside to avoid the mega-aoe attack. This one shot mega-aoe attack happens every 60 seconds from the first one. Thus, the tank and melee need to run in after each attack and continue the DPS between each aoe attack. Keep in mind that the observers will still move at their irregular speeds and there will be times when you must cut across through the boss to avoid suicide bombers pops at \u0026lt;30%HP stage. Time your movings so that you are not caught with your pants down in the aoe attack range.\nIt should only require 2-3 aoe avoids to finish the boss from 30% to 0%. To add to the fun, the boss can also do a red-circle ranged targeted attack much like Kaprima. It can be avoided the same way.\nHowever, it\u0026rsquo;s sometimes better to just eat the damage rather than trying to avoid it and thereby causing an suicide bomber pop. Main points of this boss:\nDo not allow a suicide bomber to pop. If you do, you\u0026rsquo;re fucked. Melee DD\u0026rsquo;s must trust the healer and hug the boss at all times. Never move away from the boss while above 30% boss HP Healer/Ranged DD must keep an eye on the observers at all times. When you are being sandwiched, cut across through the boss like a boss. Mega-death-aoe attacks comes every 60 seconds when the boss is below 30% HP, this must be timed and avoided. Last Boss: Meldita Once you enter the room, the tank should bring the mob to the 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock position. (Entrance = 6 o\u0026rsquo;clock)\nThis does not mean you need to wall tank the mob. You just need to stay near the wall because of the 360 degree laser one shot pattern. This laser attack\u0026rsquo;s range is about 30m so you need to tank mob here to be able to avoid it by going out of range. The tell for the 360 degree laser is, the boss will sit/crouch slightly then start gathering the light at its eyes.\nThere is also a similar attack where the mob does NOT sit/crouch but still gathers the light while staring at the random target to be lasered. It is important to be able to tell these 2 moves apart. When the boss reaches 80% HP, worms will start popping in the room. The worms must be killed asap or they will keep multiplying eventually wiping the party.\nThe worms will re-spawn about every 90 seconds. Thus it is best to pause DPS at 81%, get in position for the worm zerg, push it, continue DPS on boss until next re-spawn time, and repeat. Note: That the position of the boss must be at the 1 o\u0026rsquo;clock position during this phase otherwise the 360 laser could reach a worm location and one-shot DPS members attacking one of the worms.\nThe other strategy is to tank the boss in the middle of the room and simply run around with the laser as needed while killing worms as they pop.\nThe laser attacks can be avoided by using evasive skills as well as timed movement skills if done at the right time.\nFor the tank, simply step slightly to your right while facing the boss, wait for the laser to begin, then follow the laser as it goes around to avoid the hit. 80% to 35% is a repeat of avoiding lasers, zerging worms, and DPSing the boss.\nAt 35%, the boss spawns yet another add. This is accompanied by an on-screen message.\nThis mob leaves damaging puddles on the floor which also causes a stun debuff that will infect/stun other party members as well. The add spawns on top of the boss, so the tank should keep moving a bit to avoid the add\u0026rsquo;s puddle area every time an add spawns. A good strategy is to hold DPS at 35.1~35.2 and clear worms first, then force it below 35% to maximize DPS for the push.\nAt 20%, the same adds will pop that leave a stun/dmg puddle on the ground, but they will now be mobile.\nIt may be possible to kite these while the rest of the party concentrates on zerging the boss, but it\u0026rsquo;s probably best that everyone just goes all out on the boss at this point. Constant cleanse will be needed to remove the stun effects off of everyone and cure bombs to keep the party alive for the final push. When the boss reaches 10% HP, it\u0026rsquo;s advised that you just zerg the boss and ignore the worms.\nSources Yggdrasuk Guild Guide ","third-boss-lokmar-sorgalur#Third Boss: Lokmar Sorgalur":""},"title":"Argon Corpus (Hard)"},"/dungeon-guide/dungeon/bahaar-sanctum/":{"data":{"":"","phase-1#Phase 1":"","phase-2#Phase 2":"","sources#Sources":"The dungeon is broken up into two phases with the 2nd phase starting when you get Bahaar down to 20% health. You get loot after the first phase and you may even see LFGs for \u0026ldquo;Bahaar Farm P1\u0026rdquo; for this purpose, though probably less so now.\nFinding videos of P1 is a bit tricky since most people who regularly clear P2 would consider P1 kinda pointless.\nThe key to understanding Bahaar is to look at his hammer.\rIf it glows red, it means he’s going to do another attack.\rAll of Bahaar’s Basic Attacks have a low cooldown. All of the Special Attacks have a cooldown of 30sec - 2 minutes\rPhase 1 Menma's TERA changes:\r- Phase 1 is unchanged.\rBasic attacks Hammer Drop - Most common attack.\nIf the hammer glows, he will follow this with a Right Hand Smash that isn’t blockable but is iframeable. If it stays glowing, he will follow this with a Back Smash that is blockable and iframeable Failure to dodge a Front Dunk will result in a knockdown. Hammer Toss - The second basic attack is a Hammer Toss to the rear that is blockable and iframeable.\nThis will stun if you get hit. If the hammer glows, he will follow this with a Back Smash that is blockable and iframeable. Left hand drag - This attack starts with a Left Hand Smash which is blockable and iframeable.\nThis is always followed by a Left Hand Drag which is blockable but not iframeable. Tanks need to turn their camera 180 in order to block. Failure to avoid a Drag will result in a knockdown. Special attacks Spin - Has a similar windup to the Left Hand Drag.\nThis is iframeable but not blockable. Any shield (Kaia’s, Thrall of Protection etc) will greatly reduce the damage of the spin. Failure to avoid the Spin will result in a knockdown. Waves - Bahaar begins by stomping a foot twice. He then casts four semi-circular waves on alternating sides, starting with the side he stomps. The waves are not iframeable and not blockable.\nThe waves overlap by 2-3m, so it is difficult to walk them (unless maxed movespeed) and so movement skills are required to navigate them. The two possible patterns are shown below (right stomp on right, left stomp on left): Right Stomp (boss perspective) Left Stomp (boss perspective) Hammer throw - Bahaar has a ranged check, a special attack he does if anyone is more than 8m away from the boss. Hence, always try to stay near the boss to avoid triggering this.\nIf he picks up the hammer with his right hand, he follows this with an outer Donut. If he picks up the hammer with his left hand, he will summon it back to him and Crush a large AoE in front of him. The Hammer Throw is iframeable, but the Donut and Crush are neither iframeable nor blockable. Phase 2 Menma's TERA changes:\r- Once you hit him, he will enrage and have wrath buff.\r- He can’t do Wrath mechanic in the first 5 seconds of fight.\r- His Wrath gives him 30% more power instead of 20%.\r- Most attacks will oneshot a DPS.\r- He is a lot like \u0026lt;30% HP Bahaar from 100%. - Exception of lasers. Those will proc at 30%.\r- His HP has been increased by a lot.\rBuffs Enrage Buff - When Bahaar enrages, he gains the Bahaar’s Rage buff on the left for 15 seconds.\nIf a certain amount of damage is dealt to him within this duration, is transforms into the Bahaar’s Wrath buff on the right, which grants Bahaar a 20% power buff, but reduces his endurance by 15%. Below 30%, Bahaar permanently enrages and permanently has the transformed buff. Wipe Buff - Every time Bahaar is lowered below 30%, he gains a stack of the Scorching Vengeance buff shown below.\nThis buff persists even if you wipe the boss. At 10 stacks, Bahaar gains a huge attack speed, endurance and power Bahaar\u0026rsquo;s Revenge buff and is effectively impossible to kill. This forces a full reset of the instance. This means there is no point engaging Bahaar when he has 9 stacks, as reducing him to 30% will apply the 10th stack forcing a wipe. Key Mechanics Meteors(puddles) - Bahaar will say ‘Nothing left… but vengeance, justice, flame and blood.’, and a circle with an arrow will appear below all players. After several seconds, a Fireball will land on the circle (iframeable) and leave behind a puddle.\nThe Fireball will then roll in the direction of the arrow, so it is recommended to position such that the arrow points towards the edge of the arena to avoid hitting your party members. The Fireballs will also kill any skeletons that they roll through. They can also be used to kill skeletons Shrinking Arena - Over the course of the fight, the boss arena shrinks.\nFirst, on starting the fight, a small ring of fire appears at the edge of the room. Secondly, at 60% this ring will shrink. Finally, at 30% the ring will again shrink. As the arena shrinks, make sure to pay attention to Skeleton spawns as they have a shorter distance to travel to empower. Lasers - Below 30%, Bahaar will periodically mark a Dps or Healer with the debuff shown above their head.\nAfter a short delay, there will be a crackling noise and he will then fire a pair of lasers from his throne which are not iframeble or blockable. Players marked with the debuff should move to the side of the boss, wait for both lasers to begin firing (the second laser is sometimes delayed), then move back to the boss as shown below. Note that this can occur even during the Wave attack, in which case the marked individual should suicide to avoid griefing your team. Meteors(wrath) - During enrage, if Bahaar has the transformed Enrage buff, he will do the Meteor mechanic. This is the best time to burn the boss.\nThis mechanic begins with Bahaar saying\n‘Feel my Wrath!’ And do a semi-circular Swipe either right (see right) or left (see left).\nThis is not iframeable or blockable, but you can avoid being knocked back with Kaia’s or Thrall of Protection shield.\nHe will then summon 4 sets of Meteors to land on player. These are blockable, and it is recommended that your party groups together so that the Tank can block this for the party. Note that damage from Meteors bypasses shields, leaving them intact. When hit by a Meteor, it applies a stacking Melting Armour endurance debuff, which should be Cleansed between each set of Meteors. On landing, these leave Bombs that will explode after a short delay, dealing heavy damage. Hence the standard practice is to group at alternate sides of the boss for each set of Meteors as shown. After the fourth set, a 5 second buff will appear on the boss. This needs to be Plagued/Regressed. Once buff is removed, a new 12 second buff will appear on the boss and Bahaar needs to be Stunned when he raises his hand (bottom left) three times. Any attack that has a chance to stun will 100% stun during this mechanic. The third Stun will end the attack. Failure to stun properly will result in Bahaar wiping the party. Basic attacks Hammer Drop - The non-enrage Hammer Drop is identical to Phase 1 Hammer Drop.\nBahaar starts off dropping the head of his hammer on you which is blockable. If it stays glowing, he will follow this with a Back Smash that is blockable and iframeable. When enraged, the Hammer Drop becomes Right Hand Drag Right Hand Drag - Bahaar has a basic attack which is meant to test your skill as a Tank, called the Hilt Attack.\nBahaar will wind up then hit you with the hilt of his hammer. This attack is not iframeable, so the Tank must block it. Perfect Blocking this attack will make it deal greatly reduced damage and prevent being one-shot. During enrage, Bahaar will always have a short delay during the windup of the Hilt Attack, and will do a double Hilt Attack. Hilt Attack - Bahaar has a ranged check, a special attack he does if anyone is more than 8m away from the boss. Hence, always try to stay near the boss to avoid triggering this.\nIf he picks up the hammer with his right hand, he follows this with an outer Donut.\nIf he picks up the hammer with his left hand, he will summon it back to him and Crush a large AoE in front of him.\nThe Hammer Throw is iframeable, but the Donut and Crush are neither iframeable nor blockable. The Hilt Attack is not iframeable, and will likely one-shot if you normal block. If Bahaar is enraged, he will do a double Hilt Attack instead of a single.\nLeft Hand Drag - Same as in Phase 1\nAs this has a large AoE that extends behind the boss, melee dps and healers should make sure to dodge this. Special attacks Spin Combo - In Phase 2, the Spin is the final attack of a 4-part combo. Bahaar starts with a weak Right Hand Smash, which is blockable.\nHe then follows this with a weak 270 degree Spin which is blockable and iframeable. This is followed by a stronger Right Hand Smash which isn’t blockable, but is iframeable. Bahaar finishes the combo with the Spin, which is iframeable but not blockable. Waves - Bahaar begins by stomping a foot twice.\nThe waves are not iframeable and not blockable. In Phase 2, the non-enraged waves are face-tankable with damage reduction skills, but the enraged waves deal very heavy damage. Left Stomp Start:\nRight Stomp Start:\nThe waves are the same speed enraged and non-enraged. The waves overlap by 2-3m, so it is difficult to walk them (unless maxed movespeed) and so movement skills are required to navigate them. Below 60% HP, Bahaar will make one of two statements as he begins stomping.\n‘Scream, you weaklings! Those will be your last words.’\rThose will be your last words.’ means that the second wave will be faster than normal.\n‘I...am...the Fire Lord!’\rMeans that the third wave will be faster than normal. After the waves, Bahaar does an outer Donut that will push away anyone more than 10m away (likely ending up in the fire). If anyone gets hit by the outer Donut or outranges the Wave, Bahaar will say ‘I shall not tolerate such disrespect!’ and do an instant Front Dunk on the culprit. Hammer Throw - The second basic attack is a Hammer Toss to the rear that is blockable and iframeable, and will stun if you get hit.\nBahaar will follow this with a Hilt Attack which the tank must Perfect Block. If the hammer glows during the Hammer Toss, he will instead follow this with a Back Smash that is blockable and iframeable. Ress bait - Using Resurrection in Phase 2 will trigger Bahaar to attack you. Bahaar will either do a Front Dunk (if hammer is in right hand) which is iframeable but not blockable, or an Eviscerate (if hammer is in left hand) blockable but not iframeable.\nThe Eviscerate is delayed if non-enraged, but instant in enraged. Failure to avoid the Dunk will result in a knockdown (if you survive). Failure to avoid the Eviscerate will result in a knockup (if you survive). Skeletons - Below 90%, Bahaar will begin spawning skeletons.\nThese cannot normally be killed, and will walk slowly to the edge of the room. On reaching the fire, they will glow red and empower, then begin walking back towards the boss. The skeletons spawn with a 60 second timer above their heads, and once this reaches 0 they will die. On reaching Bahaar, they will explode in a large circular AoE, dealing heavy damage and knocking down (can be prevented using Kaia’s/Thrall of Protection shield). The first is to Sleep the skeletons, which will stop them from moving. The skeletons spawn with a 60 second timer above their heads, and once this reaches 0 they will die.

You will be pushed a lot. Key Mechanics Poisonous Gas - At 80% HP, you will receive a warning :\nℹ️ The air’s too fresh. Let’s fix that! That means the rocks will shatter in set timed interval.There are 2 rocks, on either side of the northern wall.\nThe second one will be announced by “There’s no antidote for my fury!” and will occur at 60% HP. The poison wave will activate faster and there is not enough time to close the rock once it shatters, but you can still close the rock again. Healers should be prepared to cleanse the poison when it happens. Failing to block the hole (by interacting within 8 seconds of shattering) will result in the field being covered in a wave of poison every 30 seconds. If hit by the poison, your screen will be distorted and you will receive a 10 second poison. You must jump to remove the distortion and be cleansed by a healer to remove the poison. The rock shatters again, every 1 minute and 10 seconds. (Warning Message: “The rocks scatter again.“) Chelonian Armor - At 30% HP, the turtle will hide in its shell and begin to glow white, you must DPS heavily to burn the shield. Failure to do so will cause Mephisis to deal a devastating AoE pool hitting everyone on the field.\nThis could potentially lead to a party wipe. Poisonous Breath - Mephisis will spit poison towards a player. If hit, you’ll receive damage and a poison debuff (draining 8% HP per second). This can be cleansed. Special attacks Puddle of Poison - Mephisis will target one random player with a stationary red circle (doesn’t follow you), you have 3 seconds to escape the circle otherwise you will receive damage.\nThis mechanic happens when you first engage and throughout the battle. Powerful Groundpower - Mephisis will head slam the ground twice, these head slams cause knockback.\nThe first two slams will be AoE slams in front of the boss (Tank Slams) and the third will be an AoE slam around the boss (Tank, DPS and Healer Slam). Ring of Death - Mephisis tucks into his shell and begins to spray poison in an AoE pool shaped ring around him. You can either stay close, or afar to avoid damage.\nIf hit, you will also be Poisoned (cleanse-able). Spinning Claw Attack - Mephisis tucks into his shell, hiding briefly. It will then begin to spin and move, causing damage to those who get hit.\nThis mechanic is block-able. Bathysmal Kamaras - Mephisis will begin to glow blue, say :\nℹ️ It’s kamaras all the way down! And then summon six mini-turtles. You must knockdown the boss, if you fail to do so, you will have to take on the mini-turtles as well. Body Slam - Mephisis’s eyes will glow red and tiptoe twice. Then it will body slam dealing colossal damage in an AoE form.\nYou must either block or back away to avoid damage. Second Boss: Tantibus The tank should take advantages of the corners (you may need to reposition yourself into a different corner) of the room. Try to wedge yourself to avoid being pushed around. This boss tends to move around a lot. Key Mechanics Primal Fear - The boss will begin to glow blue, say :\nℹ️ Can you control your fear? I doubt it! This means you have 7 seconds to stagger or knockdown the boss. Failure to do this will cause it to do a flip and fear everyone for 10 seconds when it slams. *This is cleanse-able.\nTantibus is hard to stagger or knockdown, and the debuff cannot be iframed. Water Wall - A message\nℹ️ Clean water fills the pool. Will notify your group that a barrier is surrounding the pool in the center of the room. You will need to DPS this barrier if you want to access the pool to be cleansed from the Phenric Slime.\nSpecial attacks Phenric Slime - Tantibus will target one player randomly with a red circle (this circle follows you). After a few seconds, it’ll be placed on the ground and will stay. If you step in the circle, you will receive a debuff which drains your MP and prevents you from gaining MP from any source.\nThis cannot be cleansed by a healer, you must run to the pool in the center of the room to be cleansed. You will know that you will be targeted as you will gain the purple ring. Don’t Look Into The Light! - The boss will randomly target a player and pull them towards the boss. It will then throw a Phenric Slime on them, causing the Phenric Slime to be where the boss is.\nThe tank would have to move the boss. You can iframe the chain. Looping - The boss will suck up any nearby players, bringing them underneath it and then slam on top of them dealing damage.\nYou can iframe both the pull and slam. Crossed Waves - During the fight, the pool will overflow. The room will split into danger and safe zones.\nIf hit, you will be flung to the edge of the map and receive flat damage. Danger zones are highlighted with a purple, watery effect. Last Boss: The tank should aim to allow the bosses back be exposed without making the DPS to DPS against the wall and leave them vulnerable. You may want to tank the boss in a circle around the arena to avoid being walled as much. Walling is fine, however the tank may be pushed to the side causing the DPS to be against the wall if they want to backcrit. Key Mechanics Floodwaters - At 85%, 55%, and 25%, the boss will disappear and you will be notified with the message:\nℹ️ Water rushes into the chamber.” Your party must relocate themselves to the inner circle of the field. You will be tossed to the edge of the field when the water reaches the inner circle. The pushback cannot be iframed and it will apply a cleanseable debuff that will damage players for a percentage of their maximum health per second. The party should gather up so they all face the same wall so the healer can cleanse the party easier. Fulmisphere - The boss will summon spheres, which he throws at players. There will be 3 of them, they do not do a lot of damage, so you can stack them to avoid having them all over the map.\nHowever if you feel they become a pain, you can kill them. They begin to do regular attacks when the message “These might sting a bit“ pops up. Lightning Shield - Fulminar will get a blue aura, start walking towards the person with primary aggro, and then swipe his blade dealing massive damage. You’ll then receive the message:\nℹ️ Fulminar gathers power for a massive attack! And Fulminar will receive a shield. Failing to destroy the shield will result in damage and being flung to the edges of the field.\nSuccess will result in the boss being stunned for a few seconds. Failing to destroy the shield and to iframe will also apply a cleanse-able debuff that ticks for a percentage of a players maximum health. Gift of Annihilation (Part 1) - You will be notified, as the boss will warn your party with:\nℹ️ I bring you the gift of annihilation. You will need to get inside the circle cage quickly. If you are outside when the cage has been formed, you will get one-shot. The boss will then carry out part 2 of this mechanic. Theres a new pattern that has six unsafe triangles and six safe triangles that alternate with each other, with the area directly in front of Fulminar being an unsafe zone. The person with the primary aggro circle (usually the tank) should move 90 degrees in either direction during Part 1 to see whether Fulminar will turn. Gift of Annihilation (Part 2) - The boss will spin and the floor inside the cage will split into different zones. These zones will alternate between red (unsafe) and non-red (safe) zones.\nAvoid the red circle patterns to avoid being killed. It’ll then jump up in the air and crash down with a Bounce; breaking the cage. Special attacks Buzz Mode - At 90%, 60%, and 30%, a message will appear :\nℹ️ Let’s speed up this dance! And the boss will disappear to summon its clones from the corners of the room.\nThey transform and move in a straight-line shown with a red line. Avoid the lines as this is a 1-shot mechanic. Every Buzz Mode occurrence will have its own pattern and the last two cutters will leave DOT lines dealing damage rapidly. Massive Chainsaw - The boss slams the ground with his razor, causing an AoE zone. Players who are on the outer edge of this zone will be drawn towards the center; those who were impacted receive the debuff Electric Nimbus.\nThis debuff creates an AoE circle around you (which grows) damaging your teammates if they step inside. Cannot be cleansed. Bounce - The boss jumps in the air and then smashes the ground on landing.\nCreating an electrical wave, it damages players and causes a knock back. Shock Wave - Turns around and launches a shock wave. This will push you slightly. Cannot be blocked.\nShock Ring - Forms a ring of electrical damage, players must be close or far away to avoid damage.\nNot to be confused with Gift of Annihilation rings. This is just a ring around the boss and will only deal damage in a static zone.

Defeat them and Balbatos will make his first appearance. After fighting him for 10% of his HP, he will summon Gorgoth and run away. First Boss: Gorgoth Basic attacks Basic Attack (Primary Aggro) – Strikes the person with Aggro twice with its snake arms and delivers a third blow. This isn’t much of a threat, but if the tank takes hits from this constantly, it becomes a burden for Healers to keep up.\nBasic Attack (Secondary Aggro) – Turns to a person with secondary aggro, swings its snake arms twice and delivers a 5-way split lightning path. This can be moderately dangerous as those lightning trails can drain 30~50% of your HP.\nRandom Target AoE – Targets farthest person.\nBest strategy is to have healer take this behind tank with some distance to prevent the boss from turning; however, ranged DPS might need to be cautious about their range while healer is doing this to avoid boss from turning around. Blender –\n“I desire a sacrifice!” Initiates with yellow 10m AoE that inflicts stun that can be iframed and blocked. The blender attack can also be iframed and blocked. Healers should be ready to cleanse the stun if necessary. However, be careful as this attack will push you across the room. Triple Donuts – The boss will flip in its place twice, puts inner, mid and/or outer at random order consecutively 3 or 4 times,cannot be iframed or blocked. Just move out of the way. Ranges of this attack seems to be 0-10m, 11-20m, 21-30m Special attacks Destructive Energy – Starting 90% HP, the combat area will be limited similar to Lilith’s Keep. Stepping on this area will inflict a bleed debuff that drains 40k HP per tick. Your party’s performance in Fire and Lightning will determine whether this area will expand or shrink. Fire \u0026amp; Lightning – Initiates every 1 minute after first time at 90~80% HP.\nSuccess shrinks the Destructive Energy, while failure expands it.\nRead the text that appears in the middle of screen, which indicates the number of members required to stand in the Fire and Lightning AoE that forms under 2 random party members. ⚠️ Fire and Lightning…the source of my power!”\r(X) for fire, (Y) for lightning.\rThe number of people hit by the orange AoE must match the X number, the number of people hit by the blue AoE must match the Y number.\nPuddles - Red AoE indicator will appear under everyone. Everyone must place these puddles as far away from the Boss possible. Failure to do so will limit your combat zone as these puddles stay for long time. Also, DO NOT immediately run in after placing the puddle as it will follow up with Blender attack. If you get pushed into the puddles or Destructive Energy. Second Boss: Molek Key Mechanics Gauge Management\rWhen the boss HP falls below 95%, Molek’s Joy Gauge will appear:\rHow the gauge works: This gauge starts with 50, and you must try to maintain it around 50 as much as possible.\nYou don’t want the boss to be too happy nor too angry, so help him control his mood swing problems.\nAbove 50, the gauge will slowly increase by 1 every 2 seconds, while below 50, the gauge will slowly decrease by 1 every 2 seconds.\nHow to adjust the gauge: When this message pops up:\n⚠️ “I will be joyful if you get hit by this!”\rThen the boss will do one of three attack patterns: 1. Circle (Inside), 2. Donut (Outside), or 3. Pizza.\nDepending on what level your gauge is, your party must either take or avoid this mechanic.\nℹ️ Maintaining the gauge between 15~85 during the entire fight will unlock the achievement: “Total Killjoy” Basic attacks Spread bomb - Most likely targets farthest target (not always the case). Boss will turn to the target with secondary aggro and throw a barrage of yellow puddles left, right and behind.\nAvoid this attack by moving (or iframe) TOWARD the boss. Also, even if you are not targeted, be careful of your surroundings as you may accidentally be bombarded by this as well.\nMust be avoided. Iframe towards the boss.\nClaw Slam - With the red flash on his eyes, the boss will raise its arms and have a seizure before slamming down which can stun you.\nIf a party member is stunned, it will say “This should keep you quiet!”, face the stunned target and throw down a barrage of slams.\nThis attack can STUN. This CANNOT be blocked, but it can be iframed\nClaw and Body Slam – The boss will raise its arms BUT he will quickly strike its claws down, try to backflip and fail horribly by landing on its belly.\nSimilar to Claw Slam, if a party member is stunned, it will say “This should keep you quiet!”, face the stunned target and throw down a barrage of slams.\nThis attack can STUN.\nBarrage of Slams – Triggers when there’s a stunned target. Boss will turn to stunned target and repeatedly smash its front with its claws. Hurts a lot. get out of it ASAP.\nCan oneshot you.\rPurple Breath – Randomly targets one person while saying :\n“Have a glimpse of despair!” and spits purple breath to the target, then follows up with Body Slam.\nThe breath inflicts SILENCE (cannot use skills for 2 seconds), and the body slam inflicts STUN. Special attacks There will be a message in the middle of your screen saying:\nℹ️ “I’ll show you the depths of Lakan’s power”\rThen there will be either Orange or Blue aura around the boss. Make sure you’re watching this aura’s color when the message pops up. Orange Aura – Breathes fire that spins completely around the boss clockwise once. One strategy is to stand near its left arm and iframe to the right arm, but since the fire spins around quite fast, you can easily iframe it without worrying about timing too much.\nTanks can just move toward left arm and move to right arm to avoid it.\nThis CANNOT be blocked, but it can be iframed This attack can be fatal.\nBlue Aura – 5 Blue circles appear around the boss (6~8m? Away from Boss), equidistant from each other in regular Pentagon shape.\nEach blue circle can only save 1 person from instant death, so anyone outside of the circle will most likely die. You can see the blue circle being filled up before the boss blasts the entire area. If the positioning of players are chaotic and some may not reach the blue circle, there are priorities of who should take the circle.\nHealers \u0026gt; Tanks \u0026gt; (Slayer, Archer, Reaper, Berserker) \u0026gt; (Warrior, Sorcerer, Gunner, Ninja) This is because Warrior, Sorcerer, Gunner, and Ninja have long iframes and if they time it correctly, they can iframe the attack.\nThird Boss: Balbatos Key Mechanics TL;DR Pick the Otherworldy Portal color closest to entrance. Place Elemental Gates near the entrance. Kill all gates except the chosen Portal color, and hide behind the chosen gate for the wipe mechanic.\nOtherworldly Portals - After dropping his HP below 95%, there will be Big Orange, Blue, and Green Portals spinning around the map counter-clockwise. After 55% or below, there will be a 4th Big Purple Portal as well.\nThe Otherworldly Portals are located like this (48 Increments of 7.5°) and move in a counter-clockwise direction.\nIf Balbatos started “I’ve been too easy on you!” mechanic at this moment, then we look 22~24 seconds ahead. This means that, if you want to safely succeed in doing this mechanic, the placement of Small Elemental Gate you want to hide behind MUST NOT be across (about 165°~180° around the circle) from the Big Otherworldly Portal.\nElemental Gates - As soon as you see those messages:\nℹ️ “I’ve been too easy on you”\r“Balbatos summons elemental gates!”\n3 random party members will have purple orb above their head and a 6-second debuff.\nAfter 55%, 4 random party members will have purple orb.\nAfter 4~5 seconds (as debuff timer goes from 2 to 1 second), there will be an elemental gate placed on them facing the center. The color of these Gates are random and there is no way of telling who has which color. Immediately after this will be a small AoE beneath each individual player, these AoEs can remove the Elemental Gates placed down earlier.\nRemove all the gates except for the “safe color” gate. Make sure to leave 1 Elemental Gate left or else you will fail the next part of the mechanic. BIG WIPE MECHANIC The boss will go to the center of the room with message\nTime to end this!\rEveryone MUST hide behind the chosen Elemental Gate that was placed down earlier. The outer portal which spits the AoE out will leave a Poisonous Field on the ground which does 100k ticks of damage, this last the entire fight.\nCannot be iFramed, Cannot be Blocked. Not even Smoke Bomb, Recall and Warp Barrier will save you.\rInstant Death.\rLeft: Safe behind the Elemental Gate. Right: Big Blue Otherworldly Portal leaves a streak on ground. 120 Degree Cone – Immediately after the wipe mechanic, Balbatos will randomly target a party member and put a large cone AoE, which instantly kills anyone inside that AoE.\nCannot be iFramed, Cannot be Blocked. ℹ️ If you clear the dungeon (kill Balbatos) for the first time, you unlock the achievement: “No Prisoners” Basic attacks Scythe Slash – The basic among basic attacks. He just either slashes the person with aggro, or turn around and slash.\nScythe Crush – Crushed wherever he is facing with the hilt of its scythe in front of him.\nScythe Slam – Balbatos will slam either the blade pointing downwards or upwards toward the person with aggro and pause for a moment.At that instant, look at the position of its blade:\nBlade is UP: He will swing his scythe around him, hitting everyone nearby.This attack has PUSH BACK effect. Blade is DOWN: Smashs his behind with his scythe or Uppercuts toward person with aggro, followed by fireballor portals getting summoned around him. If portals are summoned, the fireball will go through them, then behind him through the portal. Quick Spin - Balbatos’ eyes will flash red very quickly and he will perform a very fast spin directly around him.\nBalbatos Combo – He actually has a consecutive combination of his basic attacks.\nFireball – Targets random party member and throws fireball.\nSpecial attacks Circle or Donut – For this mechanic Balbatos will slam his Scythe into the ground and a indicator will appear.\nIf it’s a circle you need to get out or iframe, if it’s Donut you need to get inside. It give you plenty of time to react to this mechanic (4 seconds).\nIf you want to iframe the circle, you need to watch when he stomps his hoof (right foot).\nThis CANNOT be blocked.\rIt can be iframed\rWarping Breath – Two large pink warp gates will appear in front and behind Balbatos.\nHe will then unleash a purple breath attack toward the warp gate in front of him which is sent to his behind as well, inflicting damage on party members behind him.

Second Boss: Plecostoma Key Mechanics You will receive a warning saying :\nℹ️ Plecostoma is spreading parasites!” This mechanic is a wide AoE around the boss and will debuff players who are hit.\nAfter 10 seconds, parasites will spawn and attack you. Special attacks During the battle the Plecostoma will spawn an Egg, you should kill this Egg before it hatches as failure to do so will cause mini-orisks to spawn. Last Boss: Kerkion You will be given a tanking NPC to aid you (You must kill the lancer statue to start the fight and receive the lancer).

Simply kill them, no need to waste big skills on them.\nBefore the start of the fight, you should already be familiar with all following debuffs:\nStandard debuff, if you dont take any other debuff before this one expires you will die.\rFire debuff\rIce debuff\rVery Similar to Dreadspire, a bar exists that starts at 50 and will either tick up or down based on the debuffs the group has in total.\nThe bar will tick every 1 second on hard mode, increasing by 1 for fire and decreasing by 1 for ice; compared to every 5 seconds on normal mode. If everyone has the same debuff, you will wipe in 3-5 seconds on average if you do not manage it properly.\nEverything until 85% remains identical to normal mode, even the attack order at the start, so if you are comfortable in normal mode your party should be fine:\nRoar damage-heal through it Double claw-take to remove green debuff Tail swipe- dodge or kaia Big jump into forced double claw Fire or Ice aoe Boss: Nightmare Kelsaik\rKey Mechanics\rParasites - A new mechanic to hard mode and super annoying. Every time kelsaik does a random double claw, he will apply this debuff to someone.\nIts determined by if Kelsaik is enraged or not.\nIf Enraged = Closest player\rIf Not Enraged = Furthest player\rIt stacks to 3 times total and does nothing UNLESS you get 3 stacks. It lasts for 3 minutes and refreshes duration when you take a new stack. At 3 it will deal 100k per second for the entire duration and does NOT fade on death. If you ever get 3 stacks you are gonna be on the floor until its fully gone.\nIf the tank or healer ever reaches 3, wipe it up as you will never recover. An important note is that Kelsaik has forced double claws he will do after certain mechanics, these will NOT apply parasite ever. The forced claws always happen:\nAfter a Big Jump\nAfter he gives the entire room a red or blue debuff\nA Song of Fire and Ice\nAt 85% Kelsaik will roar, kding everyone unless kaia\u0026rsquo;d and youre immune to damage briefly, like Tenacity. He will then grow his ice and fire wings and roar, killing anyone hit. The roar will send anyone hit initially to the wall and then continue dealing massive ticking damage to anyone still in the radius.\nThis roar is iframeable, blue shieldable, and smokeable by ninja. Smoke bomb being the best one as it prevents both the knockback AND the ticking damage entirely.\nIframing roar:\nBlue Shield from the back:\nAd spawn on death - Immediately after the initial , Kelsaik will give everyone a debuff for the majority of the fight:\nThis will spawn a mob on you if you die at any point.\nThese mobs can be aggrod by tank but spam aoes that fuck your life up between knockdowns and aoes, think harrowhold skeletons.\nThey will despawn after about a minute or until you murder them.\rKelsaik will gain 2 new buffs until they are removed later in the fight.These reduce Kelsaiks damage taken by anyone with the matching color debuff by 25%.\nFire Resistance\rIce Resistance\rPush Kelsaik to 83% to trigger his main mechanic, hardest one in the fight for hard mode.\nIN/OUT Mechanic - At 83%, Kelsaik will do the IN/OUT mechanic, only on hard mode it happens twice back to back. Hes going to tell you 3 things:\nA color: red or blue Where that color is going to be: in or out Do you need to take the same as debuff or opposite? Graphic settings for this is utmost importance if you want to learn this without calls, as one of the tells is entirely particle based. So Kelsaik will roar and spawn a message that either tells you take same as debuff or take opposite of debuff.\nThe message is unreliable due to it easily getting pushed off the screen by another message.\nThe much easier way to tell is when the mechanic starts is to see if Kelsaik is enraged or not.\nIf he says Feel the fear / NOT enraged= take same as your debuff If he says Feel the anger / IS enraged= take opposite of debuff Kelsaik will also glow either fire or ice, this tells you a color. Kelsaiks wings will also glow with a graphic OR THEY WONT. This tells you where the color he glowed is going to be (in or out).\nHere the wings are not glowing with ice/fire:\nHere the wings ARE glowing with fire/ice:\n80% intermission - At 79%, Kelsaik will spawn 2 adds, one red and one blue. A secondary bar will appear beneath the temp bar with a graphic on it. There are multiple steps to this:\nYou need to kill the add that is the same color as the secondary bar: In this picture the secondary bar is red so kill the red dude. Killing the wrong one gives kelsaik a 50% damage increase for a minute. The add will drop an azart elixer allowing you to use to the jump pad in the room. You have 2 minutes from the time the add dies to kill a mini kelsaik on a side platform only accessed by the person with the azart elixer. The secondary bar is the mini kelsaik hp. Killing the mini kelsaik is exactly the same as normal mode but with double the hp and less time:\nNormal mode: 400m with 2 minute timer Hard mode: 800m with 90 second timer Killing the red mini kelsaik will drop another azart elixer that allows you to jump back but also gives you a 50% skill damage increase for a minute. This also makes you immune to fire/ice for the duration so you arent affected by kelsaiks resistance buffs OR THE IN/OUT MECHANIC.\nThis also removes one of kelsaiks resistance buffs, in this case red because it was a mini fire kelsaik.\n60% intermission - Same as earlier, 2 adds will spawn and you need to kill the one matching the bottom bars graphic.\nKilling the second add will remove his other resistance, allowing full damage from players with both types of debuffs finally. Weakened State\rIf you can manage to push kelsaik down to 19.9%, he will enter a weakened state, ceasing a majority of mechanics:\nParasites IN/OUTS Empowered aoes Empowered basic attacks on tank All of these mechanics will stop entirely, you only need to manage the temperature bar and push him to 15%. This gives you a breather to rez people and recast buffs/food in prep for the final phase.\nUnstable Breakdown - When kelsaik reaches 15%, he will stagger and move to the center of the room.\nHe will reduce damage taken by 95% and begin breaking down, filling the arena with shit you need to dodge and losing .1% hp per second. The goal is here is to survive for 2 minutes 30 seconds until he kills himself. Players will get a 50% healing reduction and 25% increased cdr. There are several mechanics to dodge here for the finish.\nExpanding and collapsing waves of fire and ice. Jumping makes you entirely immune to these, even jumping while riding the wave. Deals rapid but light ticking damage. Iframeable if need be for some reason. Ice and fire meteors. Ice meteors will spawn ice puddles of different sizes Fire meteors will stun you on impact, letting waves finish you off. Iframe these or move out quickly. Yellow tornaodes of moth poop. These will move around the room knocking anyone hit up into the air. Not alot of damage on their own. This entire phase is a test of how you did earlier in the fight. At 70% and every 6 minutes after, the arena will shrink, giving you less and less room to work with. Combined with the Ice meteors, space is everything here.\nThe easiest way to do this phase is to spend all your time jumping in motion. Jumping makes you immune to the waves for a very long time, even a full second after you land and move. If you jump in place, you risk a meteor spawning on you as you start your jump and arent able to iframe in time when you hit the floor.\nBasic attacks\rDouble Claw - Kelsaik will quickly stand up and slam both front claws, giving either fire or ice debuff depending on which side you are on within a very small range.\nThis is your primary way of changing debuffs and youll be doing it very often. This happens randomly but also after certain abilities. Tail Swipe - There are 2 variations of this tail swipe, one being enraged and the other not.\nThe enraged version, while faster, will only kd you. The unenraged version will send you flying. Only Arise can save you. Iframeable and kaiable to avoid kd/punt. Big Jump + Double Claw - Kelsaik will crouch down and charge up for a few seconds and jump high into the air, landing 1 full second later.\nThis will knock you high up into the air unable to do anything. He will ALWAYS do a double claw after this. Slow Double Claw -\u0026gt; Tank Stun - Unless you are directly in front of him, this is functionally a very slow double claw. Tanks must iframe/back up to avoid getting stunned. Getting stunned by this will trigger a boss backstep and knockback, dont ever get this.\nAoE Fire/AoE Ice - Kelsaik will crouch down before roaring and doing an Aoe based on the color he glows, either fire or ice.\nIf youve done kelsaik before these are nothing new\u0026hellip;for now. Fire: Hits in a pattern on and around the boss in a static way. The most important hit is the first which is directly on top of kelsaik himself.\nKds and applies fire debuff if hit. Iframing the very first hit or outranging then moving back into melee range is best.\nBlockable also.\nIce: Opposite of fire is ice which is a ticking aoe around kelsaik which is easily outranged or blocked.\nDoesnt deal much damage but gives you ice debuff. Full powered Fire And Ice - At 50% kelsaik will power up one final time, empowering his fire and ice abilities.\nEmpowered Ice and Empowered Fire aoes function exactly as they do on normal mode but more deadly and of consequence because of the bar being faster. Dodging empowered fire aoe will make or break this fight. Right after an in/out mechanic, kelsaik will place a fire puddle on the tank forcing him to move.\nSpecial attacks\rGetting Hotter/Colder - Anytime the bar gets to about 30-35 or 70-75, Kelsaik will give everyone in the room that color in attempt to push the bar further to wipe.\nHe will ALWAYS double claw after this, giving you a chance to fix it. Getting Colder\nGetting Hotter\nKnockback - If the tank ever gets stunned or other random times, kelsaik will do a slow spin that sends you flying backwards, it is blockable and iframeable.\nFire on edges - At 70% fire will spawn on the edges of the room ala Bahaar. Every 6 minutes after 70%, the room will shrink in size. For normal we will only see it shrink once.\nRange Check - If someone goes too far or gets pushed by tail, kelsaik will target them.\nHe will jump at them and then either drop an ice line or fire puddle on them. You can control entirely where he aims them.

Players only need to take care of one of the two, usually the Lancer.\nThe other will disappear if one of them dies.\nPrima can be CC’d (Stun, Sleep, Fear, etc). Let a DPS pull the Sorcerer away in the beginning and put CC on her with classes with lots of CC like Warrior, Berserker, Healers, etc. Then burn Vera as much as possible.\nKey Mechanics Noxious Fumes - Vera places Puddles that are (~10m?) wide and do not disappear. Tanks will want careful placement and positioning.\nIn Hard Mode, puddles apply “Catastrophe” debuff that reduces your endurance. The “Catastrophe” debuff cannot be cleansed, lasts 1 min until it re-stacks, and stacks up to X times. Puddle size increases as the fight continues. You can stun the Lancer to prevent it from placing puddle. Special attacks Rally - The Lancer Vera will call out to Prima during the fight.\nThe message “Vera requests aid from Prima!” appears and Prima will come to Vera’s aid and blow you away with large AoE push. Players can stun Vera immediately when he calls out to prevent this mechanic. This can happen the other way around as well, with the Prima calling out to Vera. Acid - Prima will create a large red circle around itself (~15m?) that will blow you away, messing up your rotation or skill cast/charging.\nAoE also applies “Nauseated” Debuff that must be cleansed within 5 seconds to avoid being Stunned with “Nausea” Debuff which cannot be cleansed. Prima Attacks - Prima can cast Painful Trap, Arcane Pulse, Fireball, Fireblast, and Flame Pillar.\nSecond Boss: Odon Key Mechanics Carpet - It starts to put a carpet starting at 90% and it will have a wave motion 3 times until AoE Explodes.\nIt repeats 3 times. Carpets will be more rampant as fight goes on. This pattern repeats every 20%. (90%, 70%, 50%, 30%, 10%)\nThe last carpet (at 10%) will appear 4 times.\nWhen hit by the carpet AoE, players will receive a DoT debuff, ticking off 10k HP every 2 second for 30 seconds. This debuff stacks up to 3 times. If all players successfully evade all carpets, Odon will spin in place, saying “What? Did everyone… make it out?” and becomes vulnerable. During the carpet phase, the boss receives a “Diamond Armor” buff, which increases his defense exponentially and prevents him from taking damage.\nThis buff lasts for 30 seconds, though the shield often runs out before the timer ends. Special attacks Odonitos - Eventually mobs will summon during the battle.Warned by :\nℹ️ To me, my minions!” Their attacks and the small puddle it leaves behind will inflict slow debuff. It would be a problem when it comes to evading carpet, mainly for tanks. Toxic Release - Odon curls itself and release poison from its behind.Also stuns when you get hit.\nOdon jumps into the air and lands in an AoE that deals damage. Getting hit applies Bleeding, which decreases movement speed and deals damage over time. Getting hit by this will apply Excessive Bleeding instead, which decreases movement speed and deals severe damage over time. Odon raises his front claws into the airs and then slams them down in a frontal AoE. Last Boss: Verno Key Mechanics There must be someone attacking in the front at all times, or else Verno gains buffs. so if the tank dies, someone else must attack from the front or else he gets “Hardened Bark” which increases Defense by 20% per stack and “Electrified Sap” which increase Defense and Power by 20% per stack for a few minutes. He also gains “Unpredictable Rage” for 10 seconds that will reflect a portion of received damage to the attacker. Special attacks 4-Way Pizza Bomb - During the fight you will see green gas markers appear around Verno where green gas starts to form in 4 directions, blasting a wave of poison.\nLasers - Lasers, similar to Meldita’s laser but double. Evade to the side using iframes.\nLasers starts at 90% and recur every 20% warned with : ℹ️ I will kill you all!” These Lasers will spin 2~3 times either Clockwise OR Counter-clockwise randomly. It is a guaranteed oneshot in Hard Mode and moves faster. Circle/Donut AoE - There will be orange AoE indicator before minor damage occurs in an AoE.\nSimply stay away/evade it. Two wave motion on AoE seems to be indication of iframe (on the timing of third wave). Pushback - With the message “Get Out!“, Verno starts to gather up green gas around it, shine a red light and let out strong winds.\nThere are two faces on his front and backside that will flash red before the attack. Failure to evade this will push you back. I-frame after you see faces flash. Shockwave - Starting 50% and below, it will slam its hands on the ground, creating a red shockwave.\nEvade using iframe toward Verno. 🚫 You will all burn!” = Shockwave Outward Burn!” = Shockwave Inward Mobs - Around 10%~30%, Blood Sprouts will appear once with the message :\n🚫 From the ashes, new life!“. Mobs will inflict “Chaos” in an AoE (the circle in which they apply Chaos is larger than the visible area) which will reverse your movement controls.\nKilling the mobs will drop an \u0026ldquo;Inversion Mote\u0026rdquo; which gives increased movement speed, drastically reduced damage, and grants immunity to debuffs for 30 seconds, though it won’t remove any existing debuffs. Multi-puddles - With the message :\nℹ️ Did you really think this would be easy?” He will spread 6 to 8 AoE pizza slices around him, which will apply “Doomed Hero” when hit.\nThis debuff will place an AoE under you which will explode and damage anyone within it after 5 seconds. This debuff can be cleansed.

All of the following are only in Hard Mode: If Kalligar hits anyone with an attack, he will gain an defense buff which gives him\n2% increased defense per stack. This effect stacks up to 10 times. Much like in Bahaar, when you wipe on this boss the boss wil gain a stack Once this reaches 10 stacks. The fight will basically become impossible, at this point you have to reset. There are a lot of attacks that give the players an endurance debuff, once this reaches 10 stacks it does a large AoE attack. Which will one shot everyone around you, except you.\nIf someone dies then the boss will gain an Attack buff for 60 seconds.\nIf anyone gets stunned he will say “You’re too slow” and target that person with a spin to win attack that target which applies a cleansable bleed.\nThe boss has a 10 minute timer, if this timer runs it’s a wipe and will have to start over.\nKey Mechanics 10 Stacks of Grief - Upon reaching 10 stacks of the endurance debuff, you will explode one shotting everyone around you while you get to live. Make sure you get away from the boss so you don’t kill the people around you. Ultimate griefing mechanic.\nAoE Bombs - The boss will say\nℹ️ Die, all of you!” And then target everyone with 3 circles which leave behind puddles, which deal moderate damage when standing in it.\nAfter everyone has gotten hit 3 times he will follow it up by an AoE around the players with a safe zone at the center so everyone has to walk backwards while placing down the circles and group after.\nThe final bomb (the one where you gather) has a delay on coming down even though the explosion is a bit later. You have to stop moving early.\nIf the tank goes backwards, the healer goes backwards from the side and the dps goes backwards from the back then only the DPS will need to group because the healer and tank will be out of range.\nIn normal mode you can still take damage from the bombs but there will not be a puddle.\nThe bombs deal 30% of your max HP, can be iframed or dodged by moving. Righteous Fire - Kalligar will call someone out and say :\nℹ️ Die in a fire, ! And target them with a circle of fire in which the outer circle deals damage, if everyone sticks to the boss then it doesn’t really do anything.\nQuantum Wave - Kalligar will jump in the air and slam down with an expanding circle, you have to iframe both attacks. You can either iframe back and forth or just move back a little bit and iframe forwards to dodge both at the same time.\nThe jump knocks down enemies which will guarantee you getting hit by the wave even though the jump itself doesn’t do too much damage. Shield - Kalligar will call out\n🚫 Die! And then go into shield phase.\nBefore you can damage the shield the healer has to Plague/Regress the boss. The faster this is done the more time is left over to break the shield.\nYou can technically break the shield without Plague/Regress but you will have less time to break the shield after the several seconds of the boss being immune to damage. While the shield is happening, the boss also goes into a healing mechanic where it will constantly do damage to the party based on their maximum health. Killing everyone who doesn’t get healed. Lancers can Blue Shield the explosion in case the party fails the shield, saving the run.\nPurple Magic - An attack reminiscent of the Red Magic attack in Antaroth’s Abyss, very much like that mechanic you need to look at which way he spins to know whether or not the circles start from the inside or outside. This attack is a 5 step mechanic, look closely at the videos and try to identify each step yourself:\nKalligar draws a circle on the ground with his foot, pay close attention to which foot he uses. This is used for step 5. He will stomp the same foot on the ground which has to be iframed. He will do a wave attack in front and behind him, you have to move to either side of the boss. A massive backwards wave that can be dodged by going to the front. It will do a donut mechanic as we’ve seen before, depending on the foot used in step 1 and 2. In normal mode step 5 does not apply.\nOuter donuts (right foot from Tank POV):\nInner donuts (left foot from Tank POV):\nBasic attacks Cross Slash - Simple 1-hit attack\nThis attack inflicts bleed. Double Upslash - Simple 2-hit attack\nDouble Upslash into Spin - Simple 4-hit attack, hurts a lot\nDouble Upslash into Front Stab - Simple 3-hit attack, recognizable since he starts with the upwards slashes\nDouble Slash into Cross Slash - Simple 3-hit attack, recognizable since he starts with the upwards slashes.\nApplies bleed. Special attacks Leap - Kalligar jumps into the air and slams down on the tank, stunning everyone around him.\nHas to be iframed Stomp into Spin - Kalligar stomps his target causing knockdown, this is blockable and then he spins applying a bleed and endurance debuff, this can be iframed.\nThe first hit doesn’t do that much damage and the bleed is cleansable. The spin part of this attack is same spin as he does when he stuns someone.\nSpectral Throw - Kalligar targets the furthest player and throw detachable blade at them and then pulls it back dealing damage twice causing bleed, leaving a puddle that silences and reduces endurance of people that stand in it.\nThis attack is also the range check and ress bait. Traverse Cut - Kalligar stabs the tank 6 times in quick succession followed by a large AoE attack that stuns and has to be iframed.\nUppercut into Stun - Kalligar attacks with an uppercut motion followed by a slam that deals a small AoE circle that stuns and puts an endurance debuff on the target hit\nFirst attack can be blocked, second attack can be iframed. Kick into Backwave - Kalligar attacks with an upwards kick (Brawlers Flip Kick) and throws a wave behind him, getting hit by this wave pushes you back\nFirst attack can be blocked, second attack can be iframed.

If you do reach 5, itll turn into a separate debuff.\rThis lasts forever and ticks for 5% max hp every few seconds.\nIf you reach 5x red debuff you will get 1 permanent red debuff and can begin stacking red debuff again. Reaching another 5x red debuff will give you 2 stacks of permanent red debuff etc.\rBlue Debuff Getting hit by any feet attacks(glows blue) will apply a mana draining version for 60 seconds.

If you ever reach 3 stacks, the boss will stun you for 20 seconds.\rHe will put up a shield for 10second on 3rd stack of Purple debuff\rIf you do not break this shield, the boss will pick the person up and launch them into the air followed by a divine wrath on them, landing and insta wiping the group. You cannot recover from this, as the floor becomes lava and kills you until boss resets. Total reset if failure.\rIf you succeed in breaking the shield, the boss will gain a stack:\nIf the boss reaches 10(5 on HM) stacks of this, he also wipes you. Similarly to Bahaar.\r100% - 85% Punch + counter - Simple Right punch into a right counter\nLeft punch - Right punch - Flying kick - Haymaker\nRight - Left - Backflip - random target Haymaker\nRight - Left - Uppercut Piledrive - Roundhouse\n85% Groundpounds - The boss will clap his fists and ground pound for 3 hits, the first 2 hits causing aoe on the floor.\nIf the boss is NOT enraged, you go out first: 10m is safe If the boss IS enraged, you stay in first: 5m is safe The final hit must always be iframed. If you do get hit by the first 2 hits, you will be silenced and knocked down like slayer dungeon, unable to even potion.\nThe final groundpound will kill you, no exceptions. Wrongly done:\nProperly done:\nRaw Haymaker into Knockback Kick - The boss will cast a raw haymaker with nothing before it then kick back.\nBack kick is not blockable or kaiaable, is dodgable. 80% AoE Shout - The boss will leap quickly(does nothing) and then cast a shout that does aoe.\nOne shots. Range Check - Like slayer boss, going a certain distance away will trigger this.\nThe boss will Flying kick, punch quickly a few times, then Haymaker. Ress-bait - Casting a rez will trigger this\nThe boss will jump quickly on the target, stunning anyone in a small area and then cast rampage, the final hit of rampage being the same as piledrive(aoe). 70% Phase Change At 70% the fight really starts. The boss will pull his actual weapons out and spawn fire on the edges of the room.\nThis will extend or amplify some of his previous combos.\nPunch + counter + Burst Punch - The same combo as earlier with an added Burst Punch at the end. This is an aoe around the target and kds if hit.\nFast One Inch + Twirl Stomp Stun + Backwards One Inch - The boss will quickly one inch the tank and then do a turn around stomp, stunning anyone in a medium distance.\nThis is only avoidable, not blockable or shieldable. After the stun he will One Inch behind him, sending anyone hit flying far away if not outright one shotting you. Stun trigger - If anyone remains stunned at any point while the boss is not in any animation, he will trigger a stun check.\nThe boss will spin at them, hitting 3 total times (3 HP Drain stacks = 1 Purple Debuff) if you eat them all. Blockable and avoidable. Right - Left - Uppercut Piledrive - Roundhouse - Flip Kick Stun - An extended combo from earlier, ending this time with a stun.\nFurthest target attack - The boss will say :\n\u0026quot;Ha!\u0026quot; And target the furthest person from him and quickly flying kick them, then flying kick back to his aggro target.\n70 second cooldown. Doesnt deal that much damage but remember blue stacks from kicks. 50% Buff The 50% buff from normal mode will apply instead at 70% which isnt a huge deal. At 50% the boss will gain a buff exactly like slayer boss, gaining damage and speed.\r30% Finally at 30%, the boss will unlock his final attack.\nRhytmic Blows - The boss will do a small version of Rhythmic Blows with very little windup. It consists of 4 parts:\nWindup animation Sideways Hit ; Right then Left Uppercut The side hits hit in a VERY wide arc, if you are not directly on his buttcrack you will get hit and get HP Drain stacks.\nHere is an example of melee getting hit by the side hits because hes slightly off to the side. You can see how disastrous it can be if you get enough stacks.\n30% Growing fury - In Hard mode, at 30%, the boss will use Growing fury, causing a large aoe around him, giving him a further buff to speed and power.\nThis mechanic will happen for the rest of the fight after time.\nYou are basically required to dodge everything perfectly.

Key Mechanics 85% Phase Change\r85% Pull in Mechanic - Starting at 85% and then about every minute after, the boss will hold his sword straight up in the air and begin channeling energy into it, either pink or purple energy. After 85% the boss gains a few new combos.\nThis will then pull everyone within 25m right on top of him and then do a mechanic based on which energy color it was. The pull in is not avoidable in any way aside from outranging it. Pay close attention to his sword, around the hilt area to tell which color energy it is. Pink Energy: After the pull, he will stab his sword into the ground creating 3 shockwaves. These waves deal massive damage but are survivable with damage reduction/shields.\nIf by chance you do survive a wave, you will be silenced for 5 seconds and knocked down. Because you are a silenced you cannot retal.\nThe boss will auto target anyone silenced with an overhand strike, and if by chance you survive that? a leaping strike.\nPurple Energy: After being pulled, the boss will a fast spin that applies a bleed (cleanseable) if hit directly by spin. The spin will also create a shockwave traveling outwards that stuns anyone hit. This wave is iframeable.\nFinally the boss will be charging an unsheathe after the quick spin. Its a race to escape it. The general idea is to escape quickly as you get pulled, dodging the stun wave as you go.\nFailure and you get stunned inside the unsheathe, at least it looks cool when you die. Range check / Rez bait - At any point after 85%, if a player gets a certain distance away from the boss OR if anyone casts a ressurection spell/scroll, the boss will target them.\nThese have their own separate cooldowns and can trigger back to back and often do because of how the mechanic works. The boss will target the person and savage strike to them, often through/behind them and then overhand strike. 55% Phase Change\rThe boss will say My patience is wearing thin\u0026hellip; refreshing his damage increase buff and unlocking more combos.\n30% Final Phase\rWhen reaching 30%, the boss will say Thats Enough! and charge a giant aoe. You can see the edge of it if you are zoomed out far enough.\nWhen it is near completion, iframe. The aoe can be survived if you have damage reduction or big shield skills. At the same time, he will trigger a separate set of double red line, independant of the single red line from 90%. The aoe will kill you, the lines shouldnt. The boss will gain his final form, a new buff called called Mad Power, increasing his damage by 15% and attack speed by 5%\nThis will also unlock his final combo.\rTank Buster Combo - The boss will charge up in place for a second followed by an extended combo only under 30%. The boss will do this in order: Double spin Overhand strike (will be canceled if red eye flash) Eviserate Overhand strike There will be zero delay between them\nIf you get hit by the first overhand strike, you will take x3 damage from the eviserate and INSTANTLY die.\nLuckily this combo is easily avoided as a tank. If you iframe to the side after the double spin, he will be locked on your position and simply miss the entire rest of the combo: Basic attacks Double upwards slash into Overhand - The boss will slash twice in an upwards motion followed by an Overhand strike.\nThe Overhand is not blockable but iframeable and must be. Knocks down and applies a debuff stack and a separate debuff : Weakness exposed for 5 seconds. Getting hit by most of his attacks will apply a 60 second debuff that stacks 4 times. This debuff does nothing until it reaches 4 stacks.\rOnce it reaches 4, it will change into a different debuff for 30 seconds that doubles your damage taken from the boss.\rGetting hit by most of his attacks will apply a 60 second debuff that stacks 4 times. This debuff does nothing until it reaches 4 stacks. If you do not retal immediately or your retaliate is on cd, the boss will trigger a leaping strike on you as an execution, you will not survive.\rUpward + Downward slash into Eviserate - Similar to overhand with a slight difference, his second slash will have a downwards angle.\nAll hits are blockable. Eviserate will knockdown and apply weakness exposed as well if hit. Upward slashes into backstep into random overhand - Exactly the same as the first combo but now the boss will backstep and then randomly target someone for an overhand strike.\nThe jump is particularly annoying because he will iframe all your skills during it. Red Lines - Also starting at 90% are random red lines.\nThese deal about 100k damage and apply a crippling slow if hit. -60% move speed, -70% attack speed, and -90% healing for 6 seconds.\nThese are iframeable but often come at the worst times possible. 1 at a time will happen starting at 90% 2 at a time will happen starting at 30%\nEach has their own cooldown so a total of 3 at once can happen if unlucky.\nHeart Thrust combo - The boss will stab the tank with heart thrust, do a turning slash, and then overhand directly behind him. The heart thrust and turn slash are blockable.\nThe killer here is the small turning slash he does, this mostly gets dps hit. This applies a debuff leading to 4 stacks. Double Spin into Overhand - The boss will whirlwind twice followed by an overhand strike on the tank. The spins are blockable.\nThe spins hit hard and apply debuffs most importantly for dps/healers Standing on the bosses left side as a dps/healer avoids you getting hit by spins most of the time, super helpful. Special attacks 90% phase change + Shield - At 90% the boss will say\nPathetic fools...you asked for it And phase change slightly.He will also gain a buff for the rest of the fight that increases his damage by 10% and attack speed by 5%.\nIncreases boss's Damage by 10% and Attack speed by 5%.\rFailing to break this shield will result in him doing an aoe within 25 meters for massive damage.\nIt can be tanked with damage reduction skills or blue shield only. The shield will happen at 90%, 60%, 30% OR every 90 seconds ish if you dont push % fast enough. When you fail to break the shield, he will gain a stack of Condensed Darkness, increasing his damage by 10% per stack.\nThis isnt a big deal unless you fail to break the shield 10 times in a row.\nIf he gets 10 stacks of this buff, he will gain Bloodlust.\rThis increases his damage by 5x, move speed by 50%, and attack speed by 20%.\nThis forces you to fully wipe and reset.\rTriple Spin into Punishing Blow - A variation on the previous double spin move is this: the boss will instead spin 3 times total and then do a jumping slam attack.\nAll 3 spins are blockable and the jumping attack must be perfect blocked if tank, iframed if dps/healer. There are only 2 situations where the boss will punishing blow and one of them is this, only if he triple spins. Upward slashes into Overhand into Punishing Blow - A variation on an earlier combo of upwards slashx2 into overhand on tank.\nThis time it will be followed up by a punishing blow. Double Savage Strike - This attack ruins dps lives.\nThe boss will do a quick turning slash and Savage strike directly away from the main aggro target, turn slash, Savage strike back to the tank, and finally overhand the tank Thats a total of 3 stacks if dps dont move in time from the turnslash and both savage strikes. It will ALWAYS go directly away from the aggro target and always return to that same aggro target. Spinning stun combo - There are 2 variations to this and its entirely reactionary for the tank.\nThe boss will do a small spin and hold in place for a second. The stun is blockable so thats not the issue. He will either attempt to stun you followed by an overhand strike. He will fake you out, not casting the stun and simply overhanding you. Here is an example of him faking the stun:\nSources Taldekk’s Dungeon Guide Discord Server "},"title":"Forbidden Arena (Hagufna)"},"/dungeon-guide/dungeon/forsaken-island-hard/":{"data":{"":"","first-boss-rokdos#First Boss: Rokdos":"","second-boss-viyor#Second Boss: Viyor":"","sources#Sources":"\rFirst Boss: Rokdos Key Mechanics Curse of Rokdos - The boss will say “Who hungers for my curse?” and cast a curse on the two members closest to the boss every minute.\nDebuff ticks for 8% of your max HP every 2 seconds per stack, and puts a red circle above your head. The bleed lasts for 2 minutes, and stacks to 3. At 3 stacks, the player will die.\nIf a player dies, Rokdos will say “My curse is inescapable!” and cast another Curse.\nThe boss will always do R.I.P donuts (Attack Pattern 6) after the Curse Debuff.\nSpiral Beam - Every 20% (80% / 60% / 40% / 20%), the boss will move away and spawn pillars, announced by :\nℹ️ The living have no place here! The boss will then do the Spiral Beam pattern, but you must break the pillars in time to give everyone a 3 second barrier to prevent a one-shot wipe.\nLancer can use Chained Leash on boss to destroy all pillars at the same time.\rBasic attacks Double Swing - Boss swings twice in a row towards the tank.\nTriple Swing and Sweeping Slash - Boss swings three times towards the tank, and then does a doublehanded charging sweep that hits twice.\nFan Slash - The boss crosses his weapons, points at the target, and then deals damage in front of him as a cone.\nBack Razor Slash - Rokdos does a Double Swing starting with his left sword, then turns around and deals damage in a cone of 3 lines.\nCan be avoided by standing in the right positions Special attacks Pounce - Boss will pounce on target and spin in a large AoE regardless of whether someone was hit by the stun.\nThis spin is not blockable.\rCannot be iframed.

Players near this tombstone will be feared. If the tombstone is not destroyed, the player will die. Fear Blast - This attack will push players back and can only be casted after a Pounce.\nSecond Boss: Viyor Key Mechanics Extermination - Once the boss reaches 80% health, he will start doing this attack every 1 minute 30 seconds.\nThe boss runs to the center and glows purple, before slamming the ground and releasing an energy wave that deals 150k damage. To survive, touch any one of the ghosts running around the edge of the run for a 3 second buff that deals damage over time and prevents you from using abilities but renders you immune to this attack. Touching the ghost gives ‘Curse of the Spectre’ for the achievements ‘Ethereal Chills’ and ‘Touched by Darkness’ Basic attacks Jump - Deals damage in an AoE around the boss and will push players back.\nGhost Lines - The ghosts on the edge will fire off lasers that deals damage.\nBe aware that this mechanic happens in sync with any mechanic Viyor is doing, so be careful. Special attacks Explosion Axe - Viyor’s axe will glow as he raises it in the air, and the boss will randomly target a player and slam his axe in a large AoE on the ground. After a second, the axe will explode again, dealing damage and pushing players back.\nBoth hits are blockable (block towards the boss). Thunderclap - The boss raises his axe, says ℹ️ Be gone! Pauses before swinging down and summoning thunder where everyone was. It has potential of oneshotting you. The damage is applied when Viyor’s axe slams into the ground, not after. Puddle - Viyor will target the player furthest away and throw an AoE puddle towards that person.\nStaying in this puddle will slow players and deal damage. This will disappear over time. Paralyze - A modification of one of normal mode’s basic attacks, Viyor’s eyes will glint red and he will do a swing that will stun targets hit.\nGhost Bursters - Ghosts will spawn (announced by “A spirit rises!“) and follow players until they catch up, at which point they burst and deal high damage.\nThird Boss: Desolarus Key Mechanics Rokdos’s Spectre After 90% HP, Desolarus will become immune and summon Rokdos. It has the same attack patterns and mechanics except for the Spiral Beam Pillars.\nViyor’s Spectre\rAfter 50% HP, Desolarus will become immune and summon Viyor. It has the same attack patterns and mechanics except for Extermination.\nThunderclap is warned by **“I will wipe you out!“**\rHostile ghosts will attack random targets.\rCarpets After Viyor is defeated, Desolarus will use this mechanic every 90 seconds. Desolarus flies up into the air and there will be a very high amount of large one-shot carpets appearing randomly around the map.\nGood idea to stand in a cross intersection as this allows you to avoid these by simply walking.\nThis will last 30 seconds.\nDesolarus will usually cast a Clover after every Carpet.\rBasic attacks Spirit Bomb and Dybbuk Chests - Occasionally, the boss targets a random pillar on the edge with a large Spirit Bomb.\nWhen the bomb hits the pillar, it will release a very large carpet on the ground, killing anyone who remains in the area after a short delay.\nPlayers will need to look out for a distinct blue charging animation on the chair’s legs or for the red skull warning indicator on the boss’s health bar.\nOneshot. Move away.\r3-line Vortex - The boss releases lines of 3 attacks, first to left and right sides, and then front and back.\nStay close to avoid it. 3-line Release - The boss release lines of 3 attacks, first front and back, and then to the left and right sides.\nStay close, your tank can also block for you. Special attacks Clover - The boss releases two large attacks in a clover-shaped pattern.\nGetting hit by both hits will kill you.\rDoom of Desolarus - Once Rokdos is defeated, Desolarus will start casting his own Curse, warned by\n⚠️ Who hungers for my curse?” Players will need to alternate the Curse again. Using entities like thralls/totems also works. Desolarus’s Thunderclap - Once Viyor is defeated, Desolarus will start casting his own Thunderclaps, warned by\n⚠️ I will wipe you out!” Oneshot.

Slow/Fast mode - This means ALL his attacks will be affected by this attack speed change. Time your iframes accordingly.\nThe first mode will ALWAYS be slow. There’s a permanent DOT debuff that stacks up over the course of the fight (Uncleansable) Key Mechanics Pushback into dmg pulses - When this text appears in the middle of the screen:\nℹ️ Ugh, I can’t take it anymore!” All party members should gather to the back of the boss.Getting hit by the pushback knocks you to the edge of the map.The pushback is iframeable.\nThis attack is affected by the attack speed the boss currently has. After the end of this mechanic, he switches his attack speed. Slow \u0026gt; Fast and Vice Versa. (At last, I’m Sated= Slow) (I hunger..= Fast) IF the attack speed is SLOW: Long wind up animation \u0026gt; Pushback \u0026gt; 3 Strong ticks with the final one dealing 50% HP in damage(Can survive solo with 1 50%HP pot). Healers should heal up the party and self after taking damage from the first tick IF the attack speed is FAST: Fast wind up animation \u0026gt; Pushback \u0026gt; Multi tick HP drain (Same as the mechanic that occurs when you first enter combat with the boss) IF your tank is a lancer, he or she should Guardian Barrier the pushback for the party for the fast attack speed mechanic. 8-Way “Pizza” Mechanic - At 50% onwards, the boss punches his fists then proceeds to do an 8-way attack that does 80% HP per hit.\nThe areas that get hit are the front left/right, Left/right \u0026amp; Back left/right, 4 of the zones get slammed once while the back two are slammed twice, None of these slams can be iframed and the two inner back slams stuns players in its range. This is affected by his attack speed. Special attacks Secondary Aggro into Jump - This now comes with a falling rock that falls right after you evade the initial knockup. Rock is NOT iframeable but can be avoided if you are able to jump out of the hitbox in time.\nThis attack can be triggered if someone gets hit by side push. \u0026lt;30% HP Getting hit by the knock-up triggers a charge stampede towards the player that got hit by it. This is affected by his attack speed. Stun - If he does an unchained stun, the stun hits behind the tank(can be iframed) and deals a flat 60% HP, after which he drags his claws towards himself\nBlockable by turning your camera towards the claws As a lancer you can also use Challenging Shout to take the stun while still being able to use your skills. Front/Back Push - Boss will do this when his tail has a distinct glow.Getting hit by this will result in an attack speed debuff.(20% Attack speed slow for 8 seconds)\nThis is NOT cleansable. This is iframeable. This is affected by his attack speed. Side Knockback - Boss will do this when his front claws glow. Getting hit by this will trigger the Jump mechanic.\nThis is affected by his attack speed. OUT-IN - Simple OUT-IN mechanic,however the inner AOE strike zone differs from front/back/side.\n(15m from the front, 10m from the side/5m from the back) This is affected by his attack speed. Knock up Stampede - At 30% onwards, any player who gets hit by a knockup(Jump or frontal charged claw smash) will trigger the boss to chase after them whilst attacking multiple times.\nThis is affected by his attack speed. Last Boss: Gossamer Regent Key Mechanics Debuffs (Clone) - A message appears :\nℹ️ You’re transfixed by the Regent’s illusions.” During this mechanic, the floor turns black and the boss summons a cloned version of herself. The clone will be summoned opposite of her. If the boss does a backstep before summoning the clone, the clone will appear at her original location. Taking the debuff inflicts 70% of your HP, hence healers would need to keep your party members healthy afterwards. Party members will need to rotate taking the debuffs between real/cloned as the debuff phase will happen again when the previous debuff is at ~25 seconds.\nTaking the same debuff twice kills you and causes an explosion around you that can hit allies.\nREAL Boss - Yellow debuff (red orb)\rCLONE - Red debuff (purple orb)\rThis mechanic will first occur at 80% and exactly every min after. Special attacks Spin - Boss might do the same IN/OUT AoE multiple times in a row. First happens on 95% HP.\nThe boss does either a inner AOE or Outer AOE depending on the glow of its wings. Unchanged wings\rDarkened wings\rCrystal drain - A text appears:\nℹ️ Gossamer Regent is absorbing power from the crystal!” Having 3 or less members results in a wipe.You will need a full party to gather to get through this mechanic. However, unlike NM, this now comes with an AOE pool under every player that is NOT iframeable but can be avoided by getting out of it’s hitbox right after the drain. The AOE follows you until the end of the drain, do not move too early or you risk killing your allies. Party members should gather behind the boss to make healing easier for your healer. This mechanic will first happen at 75%. Bombs - Occasionally, these bombs will appear on players that are afflicted with the debuffs.\nThe signal for this is that the edge of your screen will glow orange and you will receive a 5 second debuff which will place the bomb at your current location once it expires. These bombs will take ~10 seconds to explode normally BUT will explode immediately if hit by the in/out mechanic done by the boss. If hit by these bombs, they will do roughly 80% of your HP and apply a short silencing debuff. This will first occur after the first debuffs take place ( ~78-80%HP) Front Stab \u0026gt; Push Back - Front Stab is iframeable, Pushback is not iframeable.\nThe best way to deal with this is to get to where the tank is and the tank repositions to the front afterwards. Both front stab and pushback inflicts a DOT debuff if failed to avoid (uncleansable) Resurrection Bait - A text appears:\nℹ️ I shall harvest your soul! The boss will then do a quick push similar to the Stab and pushback mechanic. This time however, it’s iframeable. Failing to iframe will push you back, dealing 80% of your HP and inflict a DOT debuff (uncleansable). Holy Burst/Corruption Ring will prevent the knockback.

Their classes are Lancer, Slayer, Archer, Sorcerer, and Mystic.\nThe Slayer protector is the most difficult. Defeat each in order. When 3 are down, the last 2 will automatically attack your party at the same time. Kelsaik is 99% Crit Resistant.\nThe fight starts off with one of two random moves, these are usually a double rend followed by a Fire AoE, but it\u0026rsquo;s not 100%.\nThe list includes: Roll\nStun\nSmall Jump\nJump Back\nTrample into Tail Swipe - Bleed effect\nFire / Ice AoE\nFire Wall - Activates fire dmg floor\n180 degree Cleave Swipe - Bleed effect\nDouble Rend\nBoss: Kelsaik The Beginning; Phase One (100% to 75%) Kelsaik has access to all attacks listed above; for this part just DPS him down as normal.\nDPS need to make sure they\u0026rsquo;re paying attention and swapping out their debuffs. The easiest way to do this is to stand behind the hind leg associated with the front paw of whichever element you need, and then whenever he does a double rend, the element of that paw will create a low damaging conic AoE that shoots behind him. At random times during the fight, he will purple circle (secondary target) random people.\nDuring this phase that is a sign that he will do one of two things: If you get purple circled, but not stunned, he\u0026rsquo;s going to run and roll at you. This is confirmed by him scratching at the ground with his hind-right left two times before the roll starts.\nIf you get purple circled and stunned, that\u0026rsquo;s a sign that he\u0026rsquo;s going to use a deadly attack, confirmed by the on-screen prompt that says :\n\u0026quot;Kelsaik recharges.\u0026quot;\rIf this second one occurs, you need to use a Torch of the Gods (a order for this should be defined beforehand).\nThe torch removes Kelsaik\u0026rsquo;s debuff immunity, at which point everyone needs to immediately attempt to stun him. Do not overstun him though, as being stunned is always followed up with a double rend, which is the best way for people to change their Doomfire or Doomchill, and if he gets stunned out of this, he will skip it entirely. During this phase, while the torch is in effect, stack on as many debuffs/shreds as you can, because the window to do so is only 10 seconds long and then he will be immune to debuffs again. If an on-screen prompts appears that says :\n\u0026quot;Kelsaik howls\u0026quot; This is a sign that he\u0026rsquo;s about to use an AoE roar.\nAt this time everyone wants to get close as they can, as the roar will stun anyone caught in it for about 8-9 seconds. Finally, at random times he may spawn a barrier that places a buff on him called \u0026ldquo;Armor of Doom\u0026rdquo; and a debuff on everyone else called Seal of Revenge.\nArmor of Doom is a shield that needs to be burned down within 35 seconds.\nFailure to break the damage threshold within that time will give Kelsaik a 60 minute buff called Rampancy that will quadruple his attack power and speed, essentially meaning the run is a wipe. Additionally during the barrier phase, there will also be one of two largely damaging DoT debuffs placed on everyone that removes 20% of max HP per five seconds and decreases either ranged damage by 60% (Seal of Punishment) or melee damage by 60% (Seal of Revenge).\nThese seals cannot be cleansed. When the shield is broken, the barrier is removed and the seals are removed as well within 2-3 seconds. Seal of Punishment will always appear first; Seal of Revenge will appear if a second barrier is placed (caused by failing to reach the second phase within a set amount of time). During all of the above remember to watch for his Fire and Ice AoEs, as these are his most deadly attacks.\nPersistent Pools; Phase Two (75% to 55%) During this phase, in addition to everything listed above, claw attacks will now leave persistent pools on the ground associated with the element of the attack.\nFire claw leaves a pool of fire Ice claw leaves a line of ice. These pools can be used to more easily switch your debuff, but anyone switching needs to be aware at all times that after a claw attack, Kelsaik can follow up with either his Fire or Ice AoEs. Additionally during this phase, the mechanic behind Kelsaik\u0026rsquo;s roll is changed.\nFollowing his roll, Kelsaik will either immediately do: A short-range roar (that stuns) and then turn and do a small jump 2.Or he\u0026rsquo;ll turn first, do a long-range roar (that stuns), and then a big jump. This big jump is further signified by the way he crouches down in preparation to jump, as well as a blue mist that appears around his mane. If it\u0026rsquo;s a small jump, DPS can move right back in as the small jump is not very damaging. If he does a big jump, whoever was targetted by the purple circle from the roll needs to get to the Lancer who will then use Pledge of Protection and put themselves between Kelsaik and whoever got targetted and use Stand Fast\u0026rsquo;s defense to reduce the damage from the jump.\nAnyone who wasn\u0026rsquo;t targeted by the roll should get away until the big jump is completed. Additionally, should the person who was targeted by the purple circle die between the time Kelsaik rolls and the time Kelsaik does his big jump, Kelsaik will still jump at that person, even if they\u0026rsquo;re dead. During this phase, everyone needs to be vocal; if you\u0026rsquo;re rolled at (you get the purple circle), let people know.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re the Lancer, let people know when the fire and ice pools are coming so they\u0026rsquo;re ready to refresh their debuffs. Death Field; Phase Three (55% to 45%) Pools from claw attacks are no longer persistent.\nThis is going to be the first real hurdle as this is a DPS race.\nDuring this phase, Kelsaik puts a barrier around himself that absorbs a large amount of damage and inflicts everyone with a debuff called Seal of Death.\nWith this debuff in effect, you lose 1% of your max HP every second, and it is impossible to heal; nothing will heal you, not even potions. To get past this phase you need to DPS him down as fast as possible to remove the barrier. Once the barrier is removed (by doind a set amount of damage) and the Seal of Death is removed (takes about 2-3 seconds from the barrier being removed), the healer needs to heal everyone up. DPS does not stop though, as once the barrier is removed you have a 20-25 second window to get him below 45% or the pattern will repeat.\nIt is highly advised to go into this phase with a refreshed doomfire or doomchill, and do not try to change in the middle the of barrier; only change during the downtime when the barrier has been broken, and remember that you need to keep DPS up to prevent a second Seal of Death. This phase does not occur in Normal Mode.\nWorld Destroyer; Phase Four (45% to 0%) At this point, an eight-minute timer starts.\nKelsaik must be killed within this time frame, though truthfully this timer is not as pressing as it may seem. Just keep DPS up and dodge attacks while changing elements as needed. This is where the real fight begins, especially for your healer. During this phase a new, persistent, debuff is introduced called \u0026ldquo;Curse of Kelsaik\u0026rdquo; this debuff increases your power by x%, but at the same time removes y% of your max HP per five seconds, and can stack up to 99 times.\nThe healer\u0026rsquo;s role heal, in addition to healing, is to keep everyone cleansed of these stacks They can be removed, but they keep coming back, so it\u0026rsquo;s a constant affair. A few stacks isn\u0026rsquo;t too deadly, but once your reach 7 or more stacks, you will want to get a cleanse as soon as possible. Breath Attack - Additionally during this phase, Kelsaik will walk to the center of the arena, drop a crystal/wardstone, and then walk and jump outside of the arena.\nHe will follow this up with a large flame wave that covers the entire arena, dealing an extreme amount of damage which usually kills everyone. At this time, everyone needs to run and stand behind one of two indentations in the ground near the center of the arena (whichever one the lancer moved to).\nThe lancer in your group then needs to leash the crystal closer to everyone. Someone needs to be watching Kelsaik as he is outside the arena, and right as he rears his head back is the best time to break the wardstone. This will raise a shield from the indentation that will guard you from the incoming flame wave.\nRemember that it is better to err on the side of early, rather than late in regards to this. If for whatever reason you pass the eight-minute timer, Kelsaik will no longer drop a wardstone, but will continue to jump out of the arena.\nIf this happens, your best chance to survive is to gather on your lancer who will use Guardian Shout, Pledge of Protection, and then shield everyone with Stand Fast. They will likely die in the process, but this is a necessary sacrifice if Kelsaik is close to death. Following the flame wave attack, Kelsaik will jump back into the arena and then immediately do a double rend, so if you need to change your elemental debuff, this is the best time.\nAt 5%, pools from claw attacks become persistent again and Kelsaik enrages.\nNothing new is introduced at this point however, just keep up damage and you\u0026rsquo;ve got it.\nSources Guide Scroll KNN Guide KNN+KNH Guide by Avarice "},"title":"Kelsaik's Nest (Hard)"},"/dungeon-guide/dungeon/manaya-core-hard/":{"data":{"":"","first-boss-hrathgol#First Boss: Hrathgol":"","last-boss-shandra-manaya#Last Boss: Shandra Manaya":"","phase-1#Phase 1":"","second-boss-melkatran#Second Boss: Melkatran":"","sources#Sources":"\rFirst Boss: Hrathgol ℹ️ He gained 20% attack speed buff.

Key Mechanics Hrathgol now has a 6 minute enrage timer; in other words, if you don\u0026rsquo;t kill him within 6 minutes he\u0026rsquo;ll flip his feces and one-shot you all.\nWhen Hrathgol\u0026rsquo;s health reaches 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20%, the boss mechanic will come into play.\nDebuffs - A message will appear in the center of your screen that saying\nℹ️ \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll pray for death before I\u0026rsquo;m done. Hrathgol will then turn towards whoever has aggro, crouch down and give the three people nearest it a debuff (Cellular Decay). Every player should be watching boss health throughout the fight. When you are about to pass one of the above percentages (5% away or so), call it out and make sure everyone is ready. Basic attacks Smash - Usually right after a normal sword swipe, Hrathgol will raise both fists above it and begin charging up an attack. Shortly afterwards it will bring them down and smash the ground, letting off an AOE that hits in a wide area that includes behind the boss.\nBlockable. This AOE will give a bleed debuff to party members if they are hit (cleansable). The boss may sometimes follow this up with a pounce that creates an AOE which reaches far behind the tank. Sword Spam - Hrathgol may decide to rapid fire a few (sometimes a lot of) orange circle AOEs on the tank.\nBlockable. Some of these will reach behind the boss, so block/dodge accordingly. Each of these AOEs will also have a chance to stun you for a short period of time if you get hit (cleansable). Big Circle - If you see the boss walk backwards a few steps, he\u0026rsquo;ll usually prepare to fire a large AOE in front of him.\nBlockable. Ideally you\u0026rsquo;ll want to get out of the way as soon as you see this, but invulnerability frame through it if you don\u0026rsquo;t have time/can\u0026rsquo;t block. Getting hit by this AOE will also give you a movement speed debuff (cleansable). Hrathgol also has two secondary aggro attacks (watch for who has the purple circle):\nCircle Pounce - A random person will get purple aggro, usually one that was staying too far away from the boss (don\u0026rsquo;t do that). Hrathgol will quickly target a small circle AOE on you, then leap towards you with another attack. If you get hit by the small circle, you\u0026rsquo;ll be SILENCED and usually get knocked down\nHrathgol will almost always follow this attack with a Big Circle. Special attacks Jelly - A random person will get purple aggro, and Hrathgol will turn towards him/her and kind of growl/flex its muscles in that general direction.Jelly will spawn and fly over to whoever had secondary aggro and activate on top of them.\nDrop them somewhere away from the boss, they hurt and you cannot ressurect if you die inside puddle they create. Second Boss: Melkatran Melkatran is probably the easiest boss in the dungeon. Before you go in to attack this boss, make sure your jump and chained skill keys are different. If not, rebind one of them. You need to make sure that you can press your jump key at any time during this boss fight.\nℹ️ He is getting 13 stacks instead of 10 during the color mechanic IN/OUT Donuts will oneshot you. 5 stacks of parasites will oneshot you. Key Mechanics The boss now has a 6 minute enrage timer like the first boss. Don\u0026rsquo;t get stunned; healers should be ready to immediately cleanse party members that do.\nDebuff (JUMP) - Throughout the boss fight, you may see a message appear on the center of your screen that says\nℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Parasites flock to you. You will receive a debuff accompanied by red veins creeping over the edge of your screen. To get rid of the parasites debuff, simply jump once.\nColor Adds - This is boss main mechanic. Failing this will result in unpreventable wipe.\nThe boss mechanic here will come into play at just 70% and 20% health. Melkatran will run to the center of the room. It will turn either red or blue. Melkatran will get a 10-stack buff (a blue shield icon) under its health bar. From this point on, waves of adds will spawn on the edge of the room and run into the boss. If a mob of the same color gets to center or a mob of the opposite color doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it to center, Melkatran buff will decrease by one. If this buff disappears (you mess up 10 mobs), the boss will pull everyone into the center of the room and one-shot you. Basic attacks Stomp - Melkatran will sometimes raise his front legs up in the air. They\u0026rsquo;ll come down a few seconds later and hit in a huge range around it, including behind it if you\u0026rsquo;re close enough.\nBlockable. Getting hit by the stomp will give you a Bleed debuff (cleansable). Stun - On occasion, you\u0026rsquo;ll see Melkatran raise his shield into the air.\nDodge the hell out. NOT BLOCKABLE Either one or two things will happen after stun - either a red circle AoE will appear immidiately after the first one only slightly larger. If you wont see the red AoE right after stun, boss will do outer donut AoE instead, so move closer to him. Phase 1 MOB KITING\nBoth mystics and priests have support skills they can use to pull healing aggro on the mobs that will spawn in over the course of this phase. Since killing them is both a bad idea and would take forever, you need to keep their attention off of the rest of your party while they break the cocoon. Tanks can also kite the mobs if preferred as healers might have issue keeping the aggro on them. Throughout the fight, at 80%, 50%, and 30%, you will see a message appear on-screen that says\nℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Teleportal, open! Come to me, my minions! One phase of teleportal activations will start and one of the teleportals around the platform will begin to spawn mobs. The first group of mobs will always spawn from the southern-most pylon.\nAfter a few sets of mobs spawn in, there will be another message that appears on-screen that says\nℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Fanged gullets are on their way! Five seconds after this message appears, a ring of fanged gullets will spawn on the border between the Inner Circle and the Outer Ring.\nEach gullet will aggro onto someone in the room, run over to them, and drop a green poison circle on the floor that lasts around 10 seconds. In addition to the actual ticks from just standing in the circles, absolutely anything that walks through this poison circle will get a debuff that ticks for 7% of their health every second. These fanged gullets are the pretty much the only chance you have to kill the mobs that you are kiting. As with the teleportal message, gain some distance from the mobs you are currently kiting and dismount a bit before the five seconds are up. Keep running and have your camera pointed into the center of the platform with one finger on your support skill. As soon as you see the gullets spawn, cast a support skill and pull their aggro. Once you\u0026rsquo;ve grabbed some (hopefully all of them), remount and continue kiting. These gullets are faster than your mount speed, and will eventually catch up. This is a good thing however, since they will stop and drop a poison circle once they do.\nCocoon Moveset DD and Tank, your job during this entire phase will be to kill the cocoon. Ignore all mobs and BAMs that spawn and avoid hitting them with skills.\nIf they run through center, stop attacking and wait for them to pass by before resuming. If you do happen to pull some, stop attacking, head to the Outer Ring, and kite them around until the healer can pull them off of you. When fanged gullets are about to spawn in, do your best not to hit them.\nIt is important remember that if the healer is busy kiting mobs. EXPECT NO HEALING. AT ALL.\nMany of the cocoon attacks are now one-shot material, so having a healer at cocoon is useless.\nShandra has two lock-on attacks, one of which will absolutely destroy parties if they cannot deal with it.\nPoison Circle - Shandra will target a player and an orange ring will show up around him/her.\nThis circle will follow you around as you move, and after around five seconds, it will drop a pink circle that lasts a realllllllllly long time (few minutes). Walking through this circle will not only tick you hard, but also give you a bleed debuff (Programmed Bleeding) that halves your movement speed and deals constant damage over time for 15 seconds.\nFor MELEE, as soon as you see an orange circle on yourself, cancel your attacks and get the hell out of the Inner Circle. For RANGED, if the poison circle is targeted on you, reposition yourself so that the poison circles are grouped in clusters off to the side.\nPoison AOE - Shandra\u0026rsquo;s other lock-on attack is an identical circle, except this circle will not follow you around as you move.\nBlockable. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a block, just move out of it until it\u0026rsquo;s fired, then resume attacking. Getting hit by this will also give you the Programmed Bleeding debuff. Talons - The four talons floating around the cocoon will occasionally stab downwards and hit predefined areas inside the Inner Circle.\nThere will be a very distinctive audio cue preceding every talon attack (like grating metal, you can\u0026rsquo;t miss it. Blockable. Sometimes the talons will decide to fire off multiple times in succession, so be careful not to go back in too soon. There are two narrow safe zones right in front of and behind the cocoon. Arrows - Shandra will target someone and four light-blue arrows will appear on the floor surrounding the cocoon.\nTwo will appear first directed towards and away from the player, and a second pair will appear on both sides of the cocoon. When you hear/see the talons about to come down, two sets of long arrows will soon follow, the second set pointing 90 degrees from the first. All arrow blasts are blockable. Fence - Shandra will start sticking fencepost-like things in a small circle around cocoon (not damaging).\nAfter the circle has formed, anything inside it will get hit by an AOE that stuns the player. Blockable. If you get hit by the Fence\u0026rsquo;s stun, you\u0026rsquo;ll usually get killed by the attack that follows it, so make it a point to avoid getting hit. Tick - Shandra will target a small circle near the cocoon and plop down an AOE that lasts a few seconds and constantly ticks you for damage.\nBlockable; if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a block you should just be staying outside of the circle until all the ticks have finished. Donut - Shandra will target the entire Inner Circle except for a small circle inside near the cocoon and unleash a damaging AOE donut attack.\nBlockable, but it hits hard. If you are a melee class and you are close enough, you should be going in close to the cocoon inside the safe zone to avoid the donut and keep up the damage. If you are ranged, you should be backstepping outside of the Inner Circle. When you first start off the fight, there will be many many many poison circle lock-ons. Focus on positioning these safely. They will decrease in number as cocoon health gets lower and lower.\nBelow 30% health, Shandra\u0026rsquo;s attacking frequency will decrease dramatically. If there are party members who are dead or without charms, stop attacking the cocoon BEFORE you hit 5% health (8-10% is a good stopping point).\nAs soon as you hit 5%, the platform will soon spawn a huge horde of mobs and BAMs that will attack everyone. Burn the cocoon down before they get to your party. Last Boss: Shandra Manaya Depending on how/what you do during cocoon phase, you generally won\u0026rsquo;t have much time to prepare for anything.\nℹ️ Timer has been moved to 10 minutes. She has 46 bilion HP now. Shield has been buffed to 750m as of writing. She is way quicker, more than retail Manaya from p115. Her 20% Shield was removed. Due to the attack speed she starts attacking before shield breaks. Shield is no longer 15seconds. Changed to 10 seconds. Keep it in mind. BREAK IT QUICK. Key Mechanics Shandra has a 15 minute enrage timer. Debuff phases now occur every 45 seconds and the debuffs player receive from them last 90 seconds.\nDebuff (Stand-up mech)\nThis is the debuff mechanic you probably keep hearing about in Manaya\u0026rsquo;s Core. It starts when Shandra reaches 90% health, and will reoccur every 90 seconds for the rest of the boss fight but she can do it whenever she wants to. Shandra will immediately turn towards whoever has aggro and go into a \u0026ldquo;stand-up\u0026rdquo; state where all damage she takes is reduced by half. She will then perform three consecutive AOEs centered on herself. I will be labelling these AOEs 1, 2, and 3 in the order that they hit. The above is an animated GIF that shows how the three debuff AOEs hit during the Shandra Manaya debuff/stand-up phase boss mechanic. When an AOE hits, the ground in that AOE area briefly flashes white.\nAOE number 1 will come first.\nIt will hit in a 5m radius circle directly underneath Shandra. It will give you the \u0026ldquo;Greedy Thought\u0026rdquo; debuff and also hit you for 20,000 of your health. The area outside of the circle is the safe zone for this AOE. If you have the \u0026ldquo;Desperate Thought\u0026rdquo; debuff, it will be removed upon receiving \u0026ldquo;Greedy Thought\u0026rdquo;. AOE number 2 follows a few seconds after 1.\nIt will hit as a 5m inner 10m outer radius donut directly outside of AOE number 1. It will give you the \u0026ldquo;Hateful Thought\u0026rdquo; debuff and also hit you for 20,000 of your health. The area inside the donut where AOE 1 hit before is a safe zone, as is the area outside the donut. If you have the \u0026ldquo;Greedy Thought\u0026rdquo; debuff, it will be removed upon receiving \u0026ldquo;Hateful Thought\u0026rdquo;. AOE number 3 follows a few seconds after 2.\nIt will hit THE ENTIRE MAP directly outside of AOE number 2 (anything 10m away from Shandra). It will give you the \u0026ldquo;Desperate Thought\u0026rdquo; debuff and also hit you for 20,000 of your health. The areas where AOEs 1 and 2 hit before are both safe zones (aka the 10m radius circle inside 3). If you have the \u0026ldquo;Hateful Thought\u0026rdquo; debuff, it will be removed upon receiving \u0026ldquo;Desperate Thought\u0026rdquo;. Following these three AOEs, Shandra will immediately check to see that each of those three debuffs is on at least one person in the party. If any of these three debuffs from the AOEs are missing. Shandra will say a message:\n🚫 \u0026ldquo;Insufficient. Curl. That will hit the normal range and also automatically give everyone in the party the System Seizure debuff. This is essentially a wipe (to have even a chance of surviving, get the hell away from her and attempt to heal through the subsequent ticks with your consumables).\nBasically in order to avoid this wipe, three members of your party need to purposefully get hit by one of the AOEs each.\nNo dodging. No blocking. No invulnerability frames. They need to stand still in the AOEs and get hit so that they take their respective debuffs. In order to avoid the debuff timing out, during the next stand-up each of those three players will need to cycle AOEs so that they can overwrite their old AOE debuff with their new one. This cycle will repeat throughout the rest of the boss fight. To organize debuff phases in a manner that is clear and not confusing, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to designate certain people in the party to take debuffs beforehand. They will usually be the three DPS classes in the party (the rest of this section will assume that is the case). Tanks and healers should still know how debuffs work however, and be prepared to take one of the AOEs in case a party member dies. Designate either the tank or healer as primary or secondary backup debuff taker for moments like these in case a DPS is dead. We\u0026rsquo;ll call these three debuff takers A, B, \u0026amp; C. A will start on AOE 1, B will start on AOE 2, and C will start on AOE 3. When Shandra does her stand up and you see that message, A will stand in AOE area 1 and get hit by it to receive the debuff. B will wait in AOE area 2 to receive that debuff. And the same with C in area 3. Now A must take AOE 2 next, B must take 3 next, and C must take 1 next; this means that during the next debuff cycle, C will stand in AOE area 1 and get hit by it to cycle his/her debuff. A will stand in 2, and B will stand in 3. For the next stand-up, B will be on 1, C will be on 2, and A will be on 3. Each person will be cycling debuffs in this 123123123 order for the rest of the fight, just at different points in the order. The above is an animated GIF that shows where the three debuff takers should go during the Shandra Manaya debuff/stand-up phase boss mechanic. Depending on what color debuff you have, you will go to the corresponding AOE. If you\u0026rsquo;re still puzzled, think of each individual box as a player and just follow that player through multiple debuff phases.\nShield - Shandra will do a shield mechanic every 70%, 50%, 30%, 20% of health. When a message appears :\nℹ️ \u0026ldquo;You think to hurt me? You\u0026rsquo;ll have to touch me first! Shandra will immediately turn to face whoever has aggro at the moment and shake herself a few times.Save your big hitting skills for this.\nAs soon as you see this icon, unleash hell on Shandra. If you succeed in burning the shield down quickly enough, the blue shield buff will disappear and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a few seconds of free damage dealing. If you weren\u0026rsquo;t fast enough, Shandra will curl up and wipe you guys. Dispel buff - This is a mechanic for healers only. Once she does a message:\nℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Great ones, lend me your powers! Shandra will immediately turn towards whoever has aggro and begin stacking a buff (Queen\u0026rsquo;s Shriek, watch her health bar) with each roar she does.\nIf she successfully stacks this buff three times, the stacks will be replaced by an undispellable 30-second buff (Queen\u0026rsquo;s Wrath) that triples the power of Shandra\u0026rsquo;s attacks and gives a 20% boost to her attack speed.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t want that. And neither does your group.\nThe key to nullifying this phase are the three initial stacks. If at least one of these stacks is nullified, Queen\u0026rsquo;s Wrath will not occur. You need to land your dispel on Shandra when she is at only one or two stacks of the buff. Once you get Shandra past 8% health, if she does this phase again, the first roar will automatically give Shandra Queen\u0026rsquo;s Wrath FOR THE REST OF THE FIGHT.\nWhen you see her do her walk under 8%, she\u0026rsquo;ll also automatically gain Queen\u0026rsquo;s Wrath once she finishes the walk. The \u0026ldquo;walk\u0026rdquo; is when after you push her below 8%, she\u0026rsquo;ll turn in the opposite direction she is facing and begin slowly lumbering across the room.\nKill her immediately before she flips out, because she will be permanently flipping out all over the room. Shandra also has a new buff. At 50%, 30%, and 20%, right after her forced Debuff and Shield phases, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a message flash on your screen that says :\nℹ️ \u0026ldquo;You must know you won\u0026rsquo;t escape.\u0026rdquo; And Shandra will receive an undispellable speed buff on her bar (Fevered Pitch).\nThis buff will stack each time she does this, with each stack giving her a 10% boost in speed to all animations (even debuff phases). Donut becomes deadly at this point. Basic attacks Claw - Shandra will raise one of her front paws up and swipe downwards. It hits pretty far in front of her, so watch out.\nBlockable. Tail - If you\u0026rsquo;re behind Shandra and you see her turn her head and look at you, dodge to the side.\nShandra will slam her tail down and then taser you with it. The hitbox for the taser reaches wide, but if you\u0026rsquo;re at her side when it starts you won\u0026rsquo;t get touched by it. Both the initial slam and the taser\u0026rsquo;s multiple hits are blockable. Lunge - Shandra will back up onto her hind legs and make a huge leap across the room targeted at someone.\nDodge or just walk towards her or to the side rather than away from her, its distance is much longer than you think it is. Blockable. Comb - Shandra will bring in her paw and swipe in someone\u0026rsquo;s direction, launching a wave of energy (that looks like three combs in a row) at him/her.\nHas a narrow hitbox but hits hard and far, so watch out. Blockable. Donut - Shandra will start hovering in the air and immediately launch two AOE attacks centered on herself.\nThe first will be a donut. The second AOE will be the small circle inside the donut, directly underneath Shandra. Both AOEs are NOT BLOCKABLE and must be dodged/avoided as they are oneshots. Special attacks Curl - Also known as the bomb or the explosion. Other than boss mechanics, this is usually the attack that wipes learning groups.\nShandra will let out a distinctive audio cue and curl her wings up around her. This is your cue to get the hell out of there. Immediately turn around and get at least 19m away from her. She\u0026rsquo;ll let out huge waves of energy in a giant circle around her (18m radius) for a few seconds. The Curl is NOT BLOCKABLE. When the sparks on the edge of the blasts disappear, it is safe to head back in even if there is still a red aura remaining from the Curl. Fence - Shandra will start building a circular fence in front of her around whoever is targeted (does not inflict damage).\nWhen it is finished forming, Shandra will land an AOE that hits anything inside the fence and immobilizes them (cleansable). Blockable. Pool - Shandra will lock-on to a player with a moderately-sized circle. After a bit, she will throw down a pool of acid that will tick away at your health fairly quickly as long as you are inside it.\nThe acid pool doesn\u0026rsquo;t move after it has been thrown down. If you get targeted by a Pool, reposition yourself with just running,AFTER the acid has dropped onto you, get out of it, NOT BEFORE. Trample - Shandra will just start walking towards you.\nStand still and block. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have a block, stand still anyway. DO NOT DODGE. Save your dodge for what comes after. You will lose less health just standing still than you will trying to get away. Shandra also has a variety of secondary aggro attacks. If someone in your party gets that secondary purple aggro circle, one of the following attacks will occur targeted at him/her:\nGrenade - Shandra will target a small circle on whoever got secondary aggro and hit that circle with an AOE. Blockable, but rather easy to avoid entirely if your monitor\u0026rsquo;s not off. Laser - She will turn to face someone and her wings will come off her back and start to spin. This will be followed by a three-pronged laser that fires forward and has a huge range. Essentially a oneshot. Bird - Also known as just flying. Shandra will jump into the air and start flapping her wings. A large circle will appear under her as she flies towards whoever she targeted.\nShe will then proceed to land, and anything inside the circle will get hit hard. Blockable. Dive - Shandra will dive underground and pop up next to whoever she locked-on to.\nThis move DOES NO DAMAGE, so don\u0026rsquo;t waste your dodge. This attack will always be followed by either a Pool or one to three Lunges targeted at the same person. You should save your dodges for those attacks. Do note that if all party members are within a certain range of her (around 15m), she will not even cast this attack at all. Not getting hit by all of these attacks has a nice perk, other than not dying. There is an uncurable, green poison debuff called Argonic Metastasis that you get when you are hit by Claw, Lunge, Comb, Bird, Grenade, the initial downward slam of Tail, both hits of Donut, or any and all of Curl\u0026rsquo;s ticks.\nIf this debuff stacks 5 times (i.e. if you get hit by any of the previous attacks 5 times) before it times out, it will be replaced by another debuff called System Seizure (also uncurable) which will tick you for large amounts of health, killing you in mere seconds.\nJust don\u0026rsquo;t get hit by Shandra\u0026rsquo;s attacks. If you see you have 3 or 4 stacks built up, play it safe for a while until the stacks disappear.\nTwo-manning Debuff Phase Here\u0026rsquo;s how it works. Designate someone to start out on AOEs 1 \u0026amp; 2. The other will start out on AOEs 1 \u0026amp; 3.\nDuring first debuff phase, the first person will get the debuff from AOE 1, which will immediately get erased when he/she gets the debuff from AOE 2 (leaving him/her with just the green debuff for AOE 3). The second person will take AOE 1 to get the white debuff, and then AOE 3 to get the red debuff. Now what? The first player with only the green debuff will get AOE 1 to erase the green debuff with a white debuff, and then go out for AOE 3 to get the red debuff. The second person with both red and white debuffs will get hit by AOE 1 to erase the red debuff, and immediately get hit by AOE 2 to erase the white debuff as well, leaving him/her with just a green debuff. Repeat this cycle of 1+2 \u0026amp; 1+3 for the rest of the fight.\nSources Lostguru on personal website ","two-manning-debuff-phase#Two-manning Debuff Phase":""},"title":"Manaya Core (Hard)"},"/dungeon-guide/dungeon/manglemire/":{"data":{"":"","boss-manglemore#Boss: Manglemore":"","if-someone-else-is-the-carrier#If someone else is the Carrier":"","if-the-balloon-holder-is-a-carrier#If the Balloon Holder is a Carrier":"","sources#Sources":"\rBoss: Manglemore Key Mechanics Manglemore\u0026rsquo;s Mechanics Tricks - The trick to fighting Manglemore is figuring out when he is lying. As the NPCs around the dungeon suggest, the key lies in paying careful attention to the buffs Manglemore gets.\nKeep an eye out for these buffs. These buffs can be in any combination, such as 6-9 or 3-6-9. These buffs also give Manglemore a 5% endurance buff each. Manglemore will start getting these buffs from 90% HP and on after saying : ℹ️ Might as well be honest… I’m lying from now on!” Once you notice these buffs, you will want to keep a close eye on the Manglemore’s Change of Heart bar.\nThis Change of Heart gauge bar will increase from 0 to 100 by 1 point per second. Let’s see you dodge this! - Once the Change of Heart bar reaches 100, Manglemore will run towards the center of the room and circles will spawn around the boss. However, only 5 of the circles will have a star symbol inside, while the other 4 circles will be blue and turn anyone inside into a Snowman.\nEach person much stand on a separate star circle (cannot stack) for the party to succeed this mechanics. Once this mechanic finishes, the Change of Heart bar goes back down to 0. SUCCESS Manglemore will say “You think you got skills? Let’s see how you do without the number (3, 6, or 9)!” If all 5 members succeed in standing in a star circle, one of Manglemore’s buff will be removed (the order the buff gets removed is: 3, 6, and then 9). Each time you succeed at this mechanic, one buff will be removed. For every success, the party receives a power buff (stackable) and the boss loses any buffs it may have received from failing earlier. FAIL Manglemore will say “You didn’t see that coming?! How disappointing!” If not all 5 members are standing in a star circle, your party will fail and anyone not inside a star circle will be turned into a Snowman. Manglemore will receive all his number buffs again, as well as gain a power and attack speed buff. Snowman debuff - The Snowman debuff turns the player into a snowman with an AoE circle around them.\nThe debuff causes heavy bleeding. The Snowman debuff is contagious and will spread to other players if close enough. Special attacks Before every Special Attack Patterns, he will always say “Arghhh! You forced me to do this!”\nℹ️ I will kill you all! TRUTH : Stay outside the AoE circle to live. LIE : Stay inside the AoE circle to live. ℹ️ My shield will save me! TRUTH : Break the shield in time. Failing to break will reduce the party’s HP to 1, leash everyone and do a jump attack. The party will also receive a 7 second debuff preventing any sort of HP recovery. LIE : An AoE puddle will be placed below every player (lasts ~1 minute), so the party should move to the edge of the room to place the puddles. Getting hit by this puddle will inflict a bleed debuff (cleansable). ℹ️ One of you must die! TRUTH : Stay outside the AoE circle that forms around one person to live. Use a movement or iframe skill to prevent getting hit by the circle. Targetted will die if the circle is not iframed. LIE : Stay inside the AoE circle the forms around one person in order to live. ℹ️ No! I don’t care anymore! In the middle of any of the above attacks, Manglemire may call the attack off randomly. ℹ️ Ha! One of you is a Traitor! [Triggers below 60% HP, every 2 minutes]\nThe party will have a bomb shown above their head, and one person will get a balloon above their head and be stunned for the entire duration of this mechanic. One person will be the Carrier for a real bomb. The party (minus the Balloon Holder) must attack the boss in order for the fake bombs to disappear. The Bomb Carrier needs to stay far away from the Balloon Holder and the rest of the party. The party (except the Bomb Carrier) need to take the circle with the Balloon Holder (similar to a Kalivan’s Dreadnaught mechanic) to help absorb the flat 250,000 damage.\nThe more (non-invincible) bodies inside the circle, the less damage will be taken per person. Anyone hit by the Balloon circle will be inflicted with a Bleed debuff, so healers should be prepared to cleanse. If the Balloon Holder is a Carrier Do NOT be inside or near the Circle AoE under Balloon Holder. If someone else is the Carrier Everyone EXCEPT the Carrier must be inside the Circle AoE under Balloon Holder to share damage or else the Balloon Holder will take 250,000 flat damage. The Carrier must be away from the party.

Initiating destruction! - The boss will move to the center and blast an entire area. The floating cylinders will shoot out missiles up in the air 4 times. After 4th missile, there will be a barrage of missile falling from the skies.\nYou must time your jump to fall after the missiles start to fall from skies so that you land after all of the missiles have bombarded the area. If you jump too fast, you will be caught between missile barrage; if you jump too slow, you will die from first missile barrage as you jump out of the map. Cannot be blocked, but you can iframe the first AoE. The missiles cannot be iframed. Warning! Initiating Energy Release System. - The boss will move to the center and mark pizza patterns on the floor. The first pattern is always the same shape but the second pattern may vary.\nThen, the third pattern will combine first two patterns, leaving 1 pizza slice as a safe zone. The image below will show all possible variation for second pattern and the safe zone for third pattern. Cannot be blocked, cannot be iframed. Fatal. Basic attacks Frontal Attack - Simple 1-hit attack.\nRear Attack - Inflicts a stun that can be Blocked and Iframed.\nFront + Back Attack - Inflicts a stun that can be Blocked and Iframed.\nSpecial attacks 5x bombing Attack - Cannot block, can be iframed.\nWalks around and messes up tanking position.

Gear Crash - Cannot be blocked, but it can be iframed.\nAlso inflicts Stun. Gear Grind - Can be blocked, iframed.\nIf someone gets stunned by Gear Crash, it will roll its cylinders around the surrounding. Healers should prepare cleanse beforehand just in case. Time Bomb - First gif shows animation when it summons timebomb. These bombs are spawned on the map randomly, and they must be quickly destroyed before their timer runs out.\nBelow 50% HP, 3 timebombs will be summoned in the HARD mode. If failed to break these bombs, they will inflict bleed debuff (8% max HP per second) that lasts 10 seconds which can also be stacked and it will also decrease your movement speed. They cannot be cleansed. Temperature rising…activating ventilator. - After a message, a windy pathway will appear from random direction.\nIf you fail to get out in time, you will be blown away, causing a long knockdown. Lancer and Ninja will lose their Hold the Line and Focus buff stacks respectively. Receiving Rally Cry buff from lancer will prevent from being knocked down, you can bulllrush into the wind to avoid getting knocked back. Second Boss: Hexapleon During the run, you will notice the edges of the map sometimes show blue AoE, but this time, it’s not a safe zone.\nPistons at the edges of the map can one-shot you.\nKey Mechanics Initiate Disposal Process… - Throws electric sphere to a single random target. DO NOT go near the sphere as it will get mad and shock you like there’s no tomorrow until you die.\nIt will always shoot out 4-way lasers in 2 perpendicular lines. One of the line will always aim at the boss. He will throw 3 spheres instead in HARD MODE. These will each aim at the boss with much like the one in Normal Mode. Possible solution is like in the gif below. Initiate Area Shutdown Program… - First AoE cannot be blocked or iframed.\nSecond AoE can either be Circle or Donut. This cannot be blocked, but it can be iframed. Possible versions :\nCircle -\u0026gt; Circle or Donut\nFirst AoE cannot be blocked or iframed.\nSecond AoE can either be Circle or Donut. This cannot be blocked, but it can be iframed. Also inflicts bleed debuff.\nDonut -\u0026gt; Circle -\u0026gt; Circle or Donut\nFirst AoE will pull players in when hit and inflict silence debuff. This cannot be blocked or iframed.\nSecond AoE cannot be blocked or iframed.\nThird AoE can either be Circle or Donut. This cannot be blocked, but it can be iframed. Also inflicts bleed debuff.\nInput code verified. Processing code… - There are two scenarios for this one: 1011110 and 0111101. They represent the hint for the final attack of this mechanic.\nYou don’t need to be a coding geek, but it’s basically a binary representing on (1) and off (0)– or in this case, 1 means dead and 0 means safe. This mechanic has 3 parts, 4 cutters, 3 cutters, and 5 cutters. 1011110\n0111101\nBasic attacks Double Swipe - When single swipe is not enough.\nCutter Swing - Can be blocked.\nTakes his saw blade on his back and swings it around his body Special attacks Pizza Cutter + Rear Push Back - Frontal Pizza Cutter cannot be blocked, but it can be iframed.\nRear Push back can be iframed or blocked by the tank so the dps dont get pushed back. Electric Field - Cannot be blocked, but it can be iframed.\nLast Boss: RK-9 Key Mechanics Protection Protocol: Initiating… - Shield Phase. Break it or wipe it.\nRadar System: Initiating… - With this message, the boss will check if there’s a player far away from the boss. (approximately 14 meters).\nOuter area not verified Blast his melee surrounding in Circle AoE. Cannot be blocked, but can be iframed. Inflicts Stun that can be cleansed. Healers should prioritize Tank as they will die to almost anything at this point. This attack is followed up almost immediately with the message, but this can be iframed. Outer area verified Blasts his ranged surrounding in Donut AoE. Cannot be blocked, but can be iframed. Inflicts bleed debuff that CANNOT be cleansed. This attack has a bit of delay unlike the Circle AoE. Heat Detection Protocol: Initiating - With the Blue message, there will be red message at the same time saying one of the following:\nProtocol Activated: Melee Combatant Detection Move away, around 10 meters, because the AoE will be near the boss. (Callout for party can be “Out”) Protocol Activated: Ranged Combatant Detection Move towards the boss, within 7 meters, because the AoE will be an outer circle. (Callout for party can be “In”) Protocol Activated: Multi-range/Full-range Combatant Detection Move back and iframe forward, seen this on many bosses in the game before. (Multi-range in EU, Full-range in NA – Callout for party can be “Wave”) These messages will appear during the fight.\nThe first message will appear but the boss won’t do anything– you must memorize what it was. To make this easy, just remember the key word (Melee, Ranged, or Multi-range/Full-range). Then, the second time you see the message, the boss will initiate the mechanic, and you must act based on the two key words you saw in order. The first time he will call out a mechanic it will not happen immediately but the after that whenever he calls it out, the mechanic will proc.\nIt will always be a combination of 2 of them, so for example Multi-range/Full-range first and then Melee.\nSo this would mean that you have to iframe the Wave first and then move away from the boss afterwards because the inner AoE is coming.\nAfter the first time he does the mechanic he will only call out 1 of the keywords. The first one he does will always be the last one from the previous time he did the mechanic.\nIn our previous example if he were to call out Ranged, it would become Melee into Ranged (Out then In).\nThe only exception to this rule is in Extreme Mode EXTREME MODE Extreme Mode: In Extreme mode the boss will have a Red or Green triangle surrounding him.\nWhen this triangle is Green that means it will be the same as in Hard Mode. When this triangle is Red the order of the mechanic will be reversed. So he will do the New mechanic First and the Previous mechanic Second.\nThis color swaps will also be called out by the boss in message saying System Parameter Reverse: 1 or System Parameter Reverse: 0 Where 1 stands for Green (normal) and 0 Stands for Red (reverse).\nExtreme mode activates only during the first Shield phase at 95% HP. There will be some devices spawning around the map (if the entrance is at 6 o’clock, the devices are spawned around 2, 5, 7, 10, and 12). This can vary based on the positioning, but in general cases, it is recommeneded to have Healer/Tank take the devices near the entrance (5 / 7) and DPS (or second healer if any) take the other three located on the north side of the map (10/ 12/ 2).\nExtreme Mode and Hard Mode aren’t all that different, the differences are the following:\nMore HP and more damage Red and Green mechanic on Heat Detection Protocol: Initiating. 10 minutes timer after breaking 95% shield. The boss automatically enrages after breaking the 95% shield. So no need to manually enrage the boss at start.\nBasic attacks Stomp, 2x fisting, Rocket smash. - Block everything and you’re good.\nThe Rocket smash can damage some melee DPS players if their hitbox is displaced by skill due to desync. Non-enraged: Double front, single back smash - Block and dodge everything.\nEnraged: Double front, single back with frontal rocket smash - Block and dodge everything.\nSpecial attacks Triple fisting, Rocket bombardment, front smash + rear pizza wave. - Tank: Block fists, iframe rocket, block smash.\nDPS: long pause after fisting = run to the side as the pizza wave cannot be iframed. S-bomb - Cannot block or iframe. Avoid ASAP.\nRocket fists go Clap Clap, Single Fist, Rocket S-Bomb. It can also be double fist instead as well. Rocket fists go Clap Clap, Double Fist, Rocket S-Bomb. Immediately react to the last position of the fist. Tanks avoid diagonally away from the fist that’s on the ground. DPS avoid diagonally away from the fist that’s hanging on the air. In Hard Mode when the boss falls below 70% he will start doing Double S-Bomb as seen in this gif.\nUnknown Lifeform Detected: Tracking… - Targets Random target. It first creates about 7m radius circle AoE under the target, then suddenly expands to about 15m radius in 4 sides.\nIt expands based on where the player was facing, something like image below: A healer can trigger this by using their Ressurection skill and then canceling it. Priests need to iframe diagonally out of the range while Mystics can jaunt in any direction and make it out.

Success results in it being stunned for 10 seconds. Failure results in it being shielded for 10 seconds, aswell as it going berserker with slams. Special attacks Nimistrix’s Avatar - During the fight, a partially invisible Nimistrix will lock on to one player, noticeable by the purple aggro ring and proceed a Dive Bomb attack.\nPlayers must evade this attack, failure to do this will result in a healing debuff and damage. Second Boss: Forengula Try to avoid the Push Pods as it’ll be difficult for the whole party to stay on the boss.\nKey Mechanics Headbutt - The Lizard will target a player (noticeable by the Purple Ring).\nThe player must hide behind spawned rocks on the outer rim of the field. The lizard will charge and attempt to head butt the player. This occurs until he hits the rock, if the player fails to shield him/herself behind the rocks, the lizard will 1 hit you. Also, if you fail to stop the Lizard by making him hit the rock after 3 attempts, he’ll bury himself into the ground and deal damage when he appears. Push Pods - During the fight, small plants spawn (4 in a cross pattern), they has a small radius to begin with but gradually grow to a big size.\nThey do not deal damage, but push players out of the zones.

Your healer will need to cleanse this buff.\nThis defensive buff stacks. Growing Egg - You’ll be notified with the message that :\n🚫 Nimistrix cries out! One of the three eggs found in the bottom of the nest begin to grow to aid their mother, your party must destroy the egg as soon as possible, if you do not destroy the egg, three chicks will appear and attack you. You can kill the chicks, but this is a much harder task than DPSing the egg. Also, failure to destroy the egg will result in a debuff that will reduce your speed and remove HP. Whirlwind - You’ll be notified with the message:\n⚠️ Nimistrix calls a storm!” This is a wipe mechanic which inflicts damage on the whole playing field, except from a few circular areas which will spawn. These are noticeable by the outline of the circle. You must stand inside to avoid being hit. After 10 minutes, Nimistrix will enrage up to 3 times due to the destruction of her eggs, he will receive a damage buff which will more or less cause any attack to 1 shot a player.\nSpecial attacks Nimistrix Rage - You’ll be notified with a message:\nℹ️ Nimistrix absorbs nature’s energy” Your party has just few seconds to interrupt Nimitrix, using a stun attack, otherwise it will gain a 10 minute duration of a major power bonus.\nThis power buff stacks and cannot be removed.

If they are not eliminated within a few seconds, each (remaining) plant will give Yativio a +1% power buff. When the miniplants say \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re killer buds!\u0026rdquo; their debuff has already been added to the boss. If the plants arent destroyed fast enough, the next attack pattern is automatically triggered. Devastating AoE - The power of the recieved buffs will now unleash.\nYativio turns to red just before this attack. Few seconds later, painfull waves will deal damage in a huge circle AoE. This attack can kill anyone without a heavy armor. This attack hits multiple times so a simple evasive roll/backstep/evasive smash/shadow step may not be enough. Suicide Bombers are back! - A random player in your party will be targeted and followed by a group of suicide bombers. Two ways to deal with the situation:\nIf its the first run for your party or you are wearing a cloth armor, let the mobs catch you to leave the AoE and the mobs there far away from your party. If you have a more experienced party, you can try leading the bombers to Yativio as they deal damage to the boss too. When Yativio\u0026rsquo;s HP reaches x9 (30%), it gets a permanent buff that increases its power by 68% and attack speed by 50%.\nAt x4 (~10%) HP a big group of minions spawns again. They are too many to kill all of them, focus on burning down the boss to x0 instead. Special attacks Stun and Spin - The title says everything: Yativio stuns and gives a poison debuff to the nearby enemies, then spins dealing damage continuously.\nSecond Boss: Vesporax Vesporax gets a buff that increases its power by 68% and attack speed by 50% when reaches x9 (30%) HP.\nKey Mechanics Poison Circles Starting with the message :\n\u0026quot;Vesporax sprays the cave with acid!\u0026quot;\rVesporax walks into the middle of the room, few seconds later a group of huge AoE circles appear that deal quite high damage. Try to get out of them asap, as the whole room will be affected by the poison. There is a spot in the room (north west side of the \u0026ldquo;room\u0026rdquo;) where the AoEs can never reach.\nSpecial attacks Bees - Vesporax spawns bees announcing:\n\u0026quot;Vesporax is summoning bees\u0026quot;\rThese arent the bees you just chase out of the window in the kitchen, they deal quite high damage, however they can be killed by 2 or 3 players, so nothing really to worry about. Last Boss: Koleogg Koleogg has a 15min timer. If its not killed before the time is up, it recieves a buff that increases its power by 1000% and attack speed by 400%. You dont want that.\nKey Mechanics Shield Phase -\nAs you start the fight, its very likely that you face a \u0026ldquo;shield phase\u0026rdquo; soon.\nThere are 3 types of shields, each requires different actions to avoid. Check the shield icon under Koleogg\u0026rsquo;s HP bar to decide which type of shield it has.\nIf it is a 30sec shield, the healers should remove it (priests with Plague of Exhaustion, mystics with Regression). Koleogg has now lower resistance to knock down and stagger, your party should try to interrupt his charging for the next attack. If you fail to remove the shield and knock down, a 3-AoE attack comes. This attacks hits in three circles with Koleogg in the center.\nThe first circle is quite little, hits just around the boss. The second circle (that follows the first one a few seconds later) hits nearly in the whole room, leaving only a narrow place for the players to avoid it at the edge of the platform. The third circle doesnt have orange marker as it hits in the whole room. Each hit can take 50-80% of your HP (it can be 100% when Koleogg is enraged or if you dont have at least the gear from normal mode on +9). If its a 60sec shield, crystal phase is coming. Crystal Phase - In this phase there will be 3 crystals summoned (see the image above). All of them will need to be destroyed for the wall to appear and save you from the onehitter.\nCrystal phase happens at x24 x15 x6 (80% 50% and 20%) HP. At the first one, there will be one set of crystals to destroy, two at the second, and three at the third crystal phase. If its a permanent shield: If Koleogg has a permanent shield, your party will have to DPS it down as soon its possible. You dont have much time for it, only about 10 seconds. If you fail to break the shield, you will be dealt a huge amount of damage and will be thrown to the ground. On the top of that you will get a bleeding debuff which will kill you if not cleansed fast enough. Priest(s) should use Kaia\u0026rsquo;s shield, as you are immune to being knocked down while in effect. Special attacks Noxious Gas - I this attack Koleogg turns around and blown noxious gas from its back.\nNoxious Gas II - Koleogg flies up and blows noxious gasses in a circle on the ground. This attack has a second hit (that deals damage in a line) when the boss lands.\nIf you get hit by the gas, you recieve a debuff that decreases your movement speed by 80% and loose 2% of your total HP. The effect can be removed simply by jumping. Blue Spheres\nDonut AoE - A simple donut AoE.

Color Pulses hit for 35% of total HP. Key Mechanics Red/Blue Explosion - The boss will occasionally do an area explosion around him that MAY OR MAY NOT change his color.\nIn hard mode only this will deal direct damage to all players. You can look at the boss to see what color it is or see the color of its debuff which is below the life bar. Red/Blue Debuffs - A message will appear on the screen\n\u0026quot;Fear my rage!\u0026quot; Along with an inner and outer circle that will appear on the ground.\nIf the boss's is blue, the inside is blue and the outside is red.\rIf the boss's is red, the inside is red and the outside is blue.\rWhichever debuff you have, be it Blue or Red , you must take the opposite or else you will die.\nIf you fail this mechanic you take 50 million direct damage. - ONESHOT Special attacks Back and forth - The boss will jump back and forth.\nJumping back won\u0026rsquo;t do much damage if you\u0026rsquo;re hit. The forward jump cannot be blocked and the hit stuns for 10 seconds, this stun cannot be cleansed. If you\u0026rsquo;re a tank, you can just step back and the jump forward won\u0026rsquo;t hit you. Or you can iframe it in any way. If someone is stunned by the forward jump attack, the boss will try to kill this person by stomping. Front pushback - The boss will jump slightly and release a burst of steam from his chest.\nThe range of the attack is in the shape of a cone in front of him. It will deal severe damage and knock you back. You cannot block this attack, you must iframe it. Lancer can also use Challenging Shout to become immune. Charge - The boss randomly targets a player with a purple circle below himself and will start charging in a straight line, killing anyone in the way.\nAfter this, the boss will do it a second time targeting the tank with higher aggro. This attack will do damage through block when the boss charges at the tank. This should prevent the charge if you have low defense, but you can stop the boss from moving if you block the first hit and then back up to a safe position.\nIf you have a competent healer and good equipment, you have a chance to mitigate all hits without dying. This is something that tanks will have to try for themselves. Jump - Randomly target a player with a purple circle below them and the boss just jumps at them. Afterwards, the boss will jump towards the tank with the highest aggro.\nShot - The boss will usually trigger this attack if the aggro starts to alternate between the players.\nThe boss will swing back, target a random person and do a furious attack. Avoid him stomping towards you, it is blockable but you will be pushed back. Second Boss: Malgarios ℹ️ Spit attack will oneshot most classes. There is now 7 eggs in the room. Key Mechanics Spider baby meter - A few seconds into the fight, a message will appear in the center of the screen\n\u0026quot;The baby arachnen targets a new prey!\u0026quot;\rA small spider will appear across the room with a “Spiderling\u0026rsquo;s Hunger” meter present on your screen.\nPerson excluding the tank will be taken by an orb above their head and a debuff letting them know that you are targeted by the spider. The spider will wreak havoc when it catches you, dealing AoE damage and leaving a debuff that slows and leaves you bleeding for 3 seconds.\nIf the spider\u0026rsquo;s meter reaches 100, the spider will start scurrying around players while stunning them and trying to kill them.\nThe person with the debuff needs to lure the spider to one of the nearby eggs around the room. Just stay close to the egg when the spider is chasing you. Once the spider places its attention on the egg you have succeeded and the spider will go back to sleep for the time being. You have a limited number of eggs around the room!\nSpecial attacks Charge - The boss will turn back before doing this attack and will randomly target a person and make a charge killing anyone on the way.\nThe boss can do this attack 3 times in a row. You can\u0026rsquo;t block it but if you block before the attack happens you can prevent the boss from moving. Tanks with good endurance and a competent healer which should help you survive this attack if you want to stay in front of the boss during it. Spit - The boss randomly targets someone with a purple circle under him.\nIt will shoot circles in the area where you are, doing very little damage that is not worth avoiding. The boss can do this attack 3 times in a row. Stun slam - This attack goes through the block so iframe it. Also hurts a lot so make sure to avoid it\nThis attack hits everything around it so melee classes be on the lookout. If you are hit, you will be stunned for 5 seconds, it can be cleansed. Stun Trap - A message will appear in the center of the screen that says :\n\u0026quot;Resurrected Malgarios attracts everyone!\u0026quot;\rThe boss won\u0026rsquo;t do anything at this point, but soon he will receive a 10 second debuff where he will start to be vulnerable to knockdown and stagger. Succeeding in this prevents the boss from completing his attack. If you miss the boss\u0026rsquo;s knockdown/stagger before the debuff reaches 6 seconds, the boss will chain everyone pulling them towards him and stun them for a brief moment. After this, he will do an area attack around himself. Your stun should be gone before he can do that attack and kill your party. You can jump when he chains you and get knocked down. Priests can use Guardian Sanctuary and Mystic Corruption Rings to prevent being taken over by the chain.\nLast Boss: Lachelith As a Tank, avoid taking the curse debuff or you will suffer while tanking her.\nℹ️ Her attack speed got increased by a lot. Her tail attack oneshots. Debuff makes you take 50% more damage. Red skulls hit for 80% HP. White skulls hit for 30% HP. Key Mechanics IN-OUT or OUT-IN - Boss will briefly stop and turn her head to one side. Make sure to pay attention as it will hint on which kind of AoE she will do with her tail.\nIf the boss turns to his left with his head facing backwards, stay inside and then go outside. If the boss turns to his right while twisting his body, go outside then back inside. If the boss reaches 50%, she will always follow up with the tail slam back. Deals severe damage and a bleed debuff that can be cleared. You need to be extremely far away to avoid this attack completely if you want to outrange it.\nCircles into Curse - A message will appear on your screen which says\n\u0026quot;It's your fate. Welcome it\u0026quot;\rThis mechanic will start when the boss reaches 90% HP and repeats periodically. They will all have a circle below them that will explode a few seconds later. Simply iframe outside the circle when you see it. If you miss the circle iframe in time, you\u0026rsquo;re going to take 500,000Hp direct damage. MAKE SURE TO AVOID IT\nThe two closest players will take a 2 minute curse that cannot be cleared. The effects are as follows: You will take 50% more damage from the boss. Soul spheres will do double damage to you. Taking this debuff a second time before its duration ends will automatically kill you. In hard mode, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t let the tank take this debuff as it reduces his endurance so much that he could be one-shot by a normal attack if he makes a mistake. You can easily alternate taking this debuff with your party since the mechanic repeats itself roughly over a minute.\nPlayer A \u0026amp; B, then player C \u0026amp; D, and again players A \u0026amp; B. (for this it is important that no one is dead) Skulls - The mechanic will start when the boss\u0026rsquo;s health is below 70% HP and repeats periodically. A message on your screen will say,\n\u0026quot;Lachelith is about to use the soul sphere!\u0026quot;\rThe boss will move to the center of the room and summon 5 soul spheres in all directions. There are two different types of souls. Your party must touch the soul spheres to prevent them from touching the wall. If they end up doing it, everyone will take 30k damage and the soul will be multiplied by two. The red soul deals 80k damage to you. (160k if you have a curse) The yellow soul deals 40k damage to you. (80k if you have a curse) Make sure those with curse debuff take yellow soul, while if you dont have debuff you take red.\nLancer can use divine protection so you can collect two skulls at once. Helicopter - The mechanic will start when the boss\u0026rsquo;s health is below 50% and repeats periodically.\nA message on your screen will say\n\u0026quot;I hold your fate in my hand.\u0026quot;\rUse Regression to stop Lachelith! The attack starts from inside, middle and finally outside - in that order. You cannot iframe this attack.\nYou will take 150,000 Hp direct damage if you are hit by this attack. Healers must use plague/regression to remove the buff stack completely before the boss finishes the attack.\nIf they miss, the boss will gain a massive 1000% power + 50% movement speed per minute - most likely leading to a wipe. Explosion - The mechanic starts when the boss\u0026rsquo;s health is below 30% and repeats periodically.\nEveryone will take damage and be knocked back with a bleed debuff that takes 20% of your maximum health every second for 15 seconds. It needs to cleanse immediately. Lancer can use blue shield to avoid the pushback at the back of the boss. After the explosion, the boss will target a person with an inescapable trap circle around him, followed by two lasers. These cannot be iframed and follow the patterns 2-3 and 3-2, these: Basic attacks Right hand first - The boss will start this attack by hitting the Tank with his right hand.\nThe sequence will always be “Right hand \u0026gt; Left hand \u0026gt; Right hand” and then two things can happen OR boss can do nothing else and end the sequence. OR :\nHe can do a forward swipe that will push you back and apply a bleed buff that can be cleansed. The speed of the swipe will depend on whether it is engaged or not. If he is not enraged, the swipe will be slower, taking 1 second after the last attack, while if he is enraged it will be instant. It is recommended that when in doubt as to whether you are going to do the frontal swipe, iframe the same, since when this enrrage is very fast, and apart from that the high ping does not help.\nIf someone dies from this attack the boss will randomly target someone with a laser and the message \u0026ldquo;The friend you trust is long gone.\u0026rdquo; Left hand first - The boss will attack the tank starting with his left hand. The sequence will always be: left hand \u0026gt; right hand \u0026gt; back tail \u0026gt; front laser.\nThe back tail attack cannot be framed and does massive damage. It will also give a bleeding debuff if you are hit, this debuff can be cleared. DPS can be diagonally behind the boss and will not be hit by this attack.\nIt only does a laser in front of the tank which cannot be iframed. The laser pattern is always the same so it\u0026rsquo;s easy to dodge. Special attacks Front Scythe Stab - She grabs her scythe-like tail and slams down in front of her dealing massive damage and a bleed debuff that can be cleared. This attack cannot be iframed, you should move out of its way before it hits you.\nIf she pauses while her scythe is down, she will do a big arc attack behind her where you should block or iframe. The safe spot is in front of her in a small cone shape. You can avoid this completely if you are too far away from her. She can target this attack to any player in the party with random aggro (also known as a purple circle under you).\nRessbait laser - The boss will done a ressbait laser when your healer or anyone uses ress-skill, starting with message:\nNow, You belong to me!\rAnd fires a sequence of 3-2 lasers on the person. These lasers cannot be framed. The pattern is always this: If you receive a ress and the healer get targetted DO NOT immidiately ress up. But usually the laser will hit you before you finish casting the ress. So cancel the ress, dodge the lasers, and ress again.

DPS should consider glyphing any skills that slow the opponent down with increased duration, increased slowing effect, and/or decreased cooldown if possible. You\u0026rsquo;ll want constantly use these skills during your standard damage rotation during the first and second platforms. TANK - Glyph for anything and everything that helps with aggro; you\u0026rsquo;re gonna need all the aggro you can get for the second and third platforms.\nExtra points not spent on your tanking glyphs should go towards damage, since it helps with aggro and you\u0026rsquo;ll want to contribute damage whenever possible. Like DPS, you should also glyph your endurance reduction skills. HEALER - Your primary job for a large part of this dungeon will not involve healing, since many of the mobs and BAMs you\u0026rsquo;re going to kill will only target the center crystals anyway.\nInstead, you should glyph your knockdown and CC (crowd control) skills with reduced cooldown and anything else that may help out, as you\u0026rsquo;ll be going after bomb jockeys and keeping teraliths in perma-knockdown. In other words, glyph your sleeps, stuns, slows, and knockdown skills (see below) for decreased cooldowns and increased effect durations. Entering the dungeon Once you\u0026rsquo;ve prepared yourself, you can enter this dungeon either via instance matching or by forming a party.\nNote: If the dungeon isn\u0026rsquo;t available in instance matching, it means that you haven\u0026rsquo;t completed the questline for it yet. Upon reaching level 60, you should have received a questline which is started by talking to Fraya in Allemantheia Headquarters (A Letter from Fraya).\nThe first quest in the chain (Search for Research) has you enter Malachai\u0026rsquo;s Lab to go open a couple of boxes, while the next (Ominous Traces) has you reenter the same room to kill an imitation BAM. After finishing those two, Sirjuka Gallery will be unlocked and you can complete the final leg of the questline, \u0026ldquo;A Tour of the Gallery\u0026rdquo;.\nUpon entering the dungeon you\u0026rsquo;ll see four platforms ahead of you on your minimap. The first platform closest to you is just for this dungeon\u0026rsquo;s quest line if you need to finish it. All of the action will be taking place on the next three platforms, which we\u0026rsquo;re going to designate as platforms 1, 2, and 3 from now on.\nPoint System and Scoring Sirjuka Gallery differs from Temple of Temerity in that you will gain points for performing certain actions and doing things in certain ways, and lose them if you screw up.\nDepending on how many points you accumulate by the end of all three platforms in the gallery, you\u0026rsquo;ll be awarded with talents for your glyphs and other goodies. There are overall bonus point opportunities that apply no matter what platform you are on, and bonus point opportunities specific to each platform.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll sum up the former here, and list the latter in their respective sections throughout this guide. Whenever you gain bonus points for completing one of these requirements, your character will usually say a line of text related to that achievement, so hopefully your screen is constantly filled with speech bubbles. Overall Bonus Point Opportunities (applicable on all platforms)\nPoints Action +1000 finish anything off using your normal attack (that means the last hit on a mob/BAM must be a normal attack; use your skills until enemies are low health, then use your default autoattack for the last hits; of all the general bonuses available, this is the one you should absolutely try to get each time you kill something no matter what your role is, as there are so many things to kill and these points add up fast) +10 jump (just jump once everytime you go for this bonus, and only if you have the time to spare; this bonus\u0026rsquo;s cooldown per person is 10 seconds long so stop jumping if you just recently got the bonus, and just wait a while before jumping again) +1000 sustain Guardian Shout without getting knocked down (LANCER tanks only; you don\u0026rsquo;t have to start the shout during a timer, as long as it expires with a timer up you\u0026rsquo;ll get the points; you\u0026rsquo;ll wanna use this as soon as it\u0026rsquo;s off cooldown generally) +1000 heal a party member at critical health (HEALER only; critical health is when their health bar starts blinking (your own health doesn\u0026rsquo;t count); the cooldown for this bonus is fairly long, around a minute, so you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be making an effort to go for this regularly, if at all even) +500 type /cry after someone dies (aka. doing the mourning emote before they get up from a resurrect; this bonus also seems to have a relatively long cooldown, around a minute or so) +500 resurrect a dead player (doesn\u0026rsquo;t count if they have a free resurrect and they resurrect themselves on the spot) -1000 dying (per player, so every time someone dies, another 1000 points are docked) As mentioned before, each of the three platforms have additional ways to score bonus points, and will be mentioned in each section below as they come.\nPlatform 1 Preparation Once you get onto the first platform, you\u0026rsquo;ll see some mobs attacking a center crystal and four smaller green crystals (from now on, shards) on the edges of the platform, one northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.\nThese shards are fenced in, and they denote the spawn locations of the mobs that will spawn on this platform.\nFrom now on, I\u0026rsquo;ll be referring to these locations with the previously mentioned cardinal directions. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about the mobs in the center attacking the crystal; they do no damage to the crystal, so there\u0026rsquo;s no rush to kill them. If your tank is a warrior, it\u0026rsquo;s usually not a bad idea for him/her to go assault stance; there isn\u0026rsquo;t much important to hold aggro on, as most of the crucial mobs that need to be killed before they reach center cannot be aggro\u0026rsquo;d.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s usually no need to swap out glyphs for damage glyphs unless your party damage dealers are really bad at their job. Since the bonus points for healing a party member at critical health are usually too risky to go for (and since healers have their hands full with jockeys), it is usually standard to just get the bonus at the beginning of the platform and have everyone focus on their roles for the rest of the platform.\nTo get the bonus, have a party member get down to critical health before the platform begins and just heal him/her once the platform starts. There\u0026rsquo;s no point in having more than one player do so due to the cooldown on the bonus. Here are ways to lower health for the immediate saving party member bonus, depending on the members in your party:\nWarriors - spam combative strike ; begin the casting of smoke aggressor and cancel with death from above or evasive roll Berzerkers - unchained anger; overcharge lethal strike and other skills and block cancel Archers - overcharge skills Other classes - duel each other DPS and TANK should each go to one of the crystals around the edge of the platform and start whittling their health down (if you have a lancer tank, send him to the northeast crystal so he can grab aggro on the first wave of mobs after the red ones, otherwise send your highest dps; this isn\u0026rsquo;t too important though).\nNOT DESTROY THEM, just bring them down to around 5% or so, use your judgement. As you near 30-50% health you might want to start just using normal attacks since a stray crit can lose you 1000 points. Once your crystal is prepped, tell your party and just wait beside it and begin spamming jump (it\u0026rsquo;s a good idea to keep that bound to a different key than your chained skill key.\nHEALER will go to the middle and start whittling the health of the mobs there down.\nDO NOT KILL THEM YET. Wait until each person at a crystal gives you a ready flag that their crystal is prepped at low health. Once everyone\u0026rsquo;s buffed and ready, finish the mobs off to start the platform. Lancer tanks can activate Guardian Shout when the party is almost ready.\nDefense Bonus Point Opportunities Points Action +1000 destroy a contaminated crystal (Ificio Shard; the ones on the edge of the platform that you whittled down just now) +100 kill a mob (aim for normal attack finishes for the 1000 bonus, as it is worth far more) +500 kill a jockey in a short period of time after you first engage it (don\u0026rsquo;t try going for this unless your healer is off sitting in a corner; as a healer chances are you\u0026rsquo;ll never even see this at all) +5000 clear the platform without letting the center crystal break +3000 keep center crystal health above 75% (if no message appears during the platform saying the crystal is starting to crack, you\u0026rsquo;ll get these points upon completion) +25000 complete the platform with more than five minutes to spare (for every additional second over five minutes, another +50 points are added onto this) -500 let the center crystal break As soon as all the mobs in the middle are killed by the healer, a timer and on-screen message will appear. Bonus point opportunities can be claimed as long as this timer is up.\nDPS (\u0026amp; TANK) should break their crystals as soon as the timer starts.\nImmediately, a giant red mob (Colossal Deskera Imp) will spawn at your location and make a beeline for the center crystal. They are unaggroable, so kill them quickly. They get knocked over fairly easily, so be sure you don\u0026rsquo;t knock it too far away from yourself as you try and kill it with a normal attack. As soon as you finish, head to the northeast side of the platform in preparation for the first group of mobs.\nFunnily enough, the Deskera Imp is the kill required by instance matching, so if you instance matched into the dungeon, you should receive a parcel post with your Valkyon\u0026rsquo;s Response as soon as a party member kills one. If any party members decided to get themselves to critical before the platform started, the HEALER should heal them as soon as possible then immediately assume jockey duty.\nThe healer\u0026rsquo;s job is to prevent the Lab Jockeys from reaching the crystal and throwing their bombs (they hit HARD).\nThey appear at set intervals randomly at any one of the four spawns, are unaggroable, and make a beeline for the crystal. Use sleeps, slows, and stuns anytime you need to. They\u0026rsquo;re prone to knockdowns as well, so use that fact to your advantage and keep your knockdown skill on cooldown. A good tactic is usually to sleep the jockey as soon as you see it, then start off your damage rotation with your knockdown skill.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re having trouble spotting jockeys, use your compass to help out; it\u0026rsquo;s range is enough to cover the entire platform if you stand in the center, so just watch for the orange dots that appear on the edges. Make sure you still pan around the platform manually though, as sometimes you won\u0026rsquo;t see the jockey if it\u0026rsquo;s in the midst of a bunch of other mobs.\nGenerally the healer will be enough for this job, but if he/she isn\u0026rsquo;t confident or you\u0026rsquo;re doing a learning run, the tank can help.\nUsually if your party damage is enough, the TANK can prioritize jockeys over other mobs, and should come help kill them as needed with his/her stuns and knockdowns if they get near the crystal. If it helps, tank and healer can divide the platform between them to kill jockeys faster. The next mobs will spawn northeast where the DPS (\u0026amp; TANK) are waiting.\nKill these mobs; the TANK can pull aggro on these when they first spawn to help out the damage dealers; as soon as these are killed (normal attacks please), head back to the middle of the arena to kill the archers that have spawned. If you happen to see a jockey run past you, feel free to kill it as well, but don\u0026rsquo;t make it a priority (they\u0026rsquo;re the healer\u0026rsquo;s job) unless it\u0026rsquo;s too close to the crystal for comfort. As soon as there are only a few archers at low health left to kill, leave one DPS to finish them off and have the rest of the DPS head over to thesouthwest side of the platform. Generally, whoever has the most slows (such as a sorcerer or archer) should be the first to peel off and greet any new mobs that are spawning in. At southwest spawn after the archer mobs, DPS (\u0026amp; TANK) will need to kill the Ossugon Tyrant that has just spawned in; he cannot be aggro\u0026rsquo;d so slow him down as much as you can and kill him before he reaches the center; soon after, a pair of gulon hunters will spawn from the same spot; they also cannot be aggro\u0026rsquo;d, so kill them as soon as possible with the help of your slows. As these hunters grow close to dead, the DPSshould begin peeling off to head to the northeastern side of the platform.\nNortheast, four Thulsan elite soldiers will spawn that will absolutely DESTROY your crystal if you let them get to the center.\nMake sure at least one damage dealer is there to greet them, preferably with slows. Unleash hell on these guys and use whatever you can to slow them down (stuns are useless, but endurance debuffs work wonders). The TANK can pull aggro on these guys to help divert their attention for a few seconds, but remember they hit like a bus (definitely go stalwart cruxes if you decide to do this. If you feel like you won\u0026rsquo;t make it before these guys reach the crystal, don\u0026rsquo;t push yourself to normal attack the last hit on these guys, as the amount of damage they can deal to your crystal is not worth the risk (one hit pretty much negates your 75% health bonus opportunity).\nAfter those are dead, DPS (\u0026amp; TANK) should head back to the northeast side to greet the gallery ghilliedhus that are beginning to spawn in ( unaggroable).\nThese will spawn clockwise around the platform, one at each spawn, so as one ghilliedhu is near dead, DPS should start to peel off and head to the next spawn point clockwise; do this until all four ghilliedhus are dead. Having everyone start at the northeastern ghilliedhu speeds killing, so do that. While you usually won\u0026rsquo;t have trouble with these mobs, they do happen to do a huge amount of damage with their attacks as well, so don\u0026rsquo;t let them get to the crystal either. At the ghilliedhus are dead, THE WHOLE PARTY should be jumping for the bonus points and on jockey duty.\nDO NOT STOP UNTIL THE CENTER CRYSTAL DISAPPEARS, as jockeys will continue to spawn in until the platform is officially over.\nOnce the crystal disappears, you\u0026rsquo;re safe to prep for the next platform. Platform 2 Preparation Like the first platform, there will be shards along the perimeter of the platform, except this time, there are only three.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re northeast,northwest, and south. The mobs in the center are identical to the ones from the first platform, so rest easy.\nOnly really difference in layout is that there are barrels along the northern, southwestern, and southeastern sides of the platform. THESE BARRELS WILL ONE-SHOT YOU, so don\u0026rsquo;t touch them if at all possible. Leave them to the tank. TANKS should note that it is important to keep aggro on all of their assigned BAMs for this platform; once these BAMS reach the crystal, it will be close to impossible to pull them off without the center crystal taking damage.\nBe careful not to venture too far away from the BAMs you need to kite, or else you\u0026rsquo;ll lose aggro rather quickly to the center crystal. Warrior tanks should switch back to defensive stance and tanking glyphs now if they haven\u0026rsquo;t already.\nThere will be three teraliths on this platform that you will not want to kill, but instead, keep knocked-down for the bonus points they give. Teralith 1 will spawn in from the northeastern spawn, teralith 2 from the northwest, and teralith 3 from the south.\nDesignate one DPS(probably the melee class with the least amount of overall dps) to knockdown teralith 1 (I\u0026rsquo;ll refer to the designated person as DPST from now on) The HEALER will be assigned to teraliths 2 \u0026amp; 3 (if healer will have trouble, have the tank assigned to 3); more on that below. Double check that you know your knockdown skills. It should be noted that teraliths gain knockdown resistance every time they get knocked down, so you don\u0026rsquo;t have all the time in the world to kill the other BAMs.\nFeel free to have a party member go critical for the healing bonus again, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s not the tank this time.\nDPS \u0026amp; TANK should each go to a crystal and start whittling their health down; make sure TANK takes the northeastern crystal alone or is waiting near it alone before the platform is started, as the first BAM he/she needs to kite spawns there.\nSince there are only three shards on this platform, one damage dealer will often be left behind. Preferably, this dps will be the one getting his/her health down to critical; if this is the case, have him/her wait by the healer in the middle for a quick heal right after the platform starts. Otherwise, wait northwest. HEALER will go to the middle and start whittling the health of the mobs there down; wait until each person at a crystal gives you a ready flag that their crystal is prepped at low health. Once everyone\u0026rsquo;s ready, kill the mobs to start the platform.\nLancer tanks can activate Guardian Shout when the party is almost ready.\nDefense Bonus Point Opportunities Points Action +1000 destroy a contaminated crystal (Ificio Shard; the ones on the edge of the platform that you whittled down just now) +1000 kill a monster with a barrel explosion (lure the BAMs into these for fast kill times, those throwable bomb consumables also work for breaking the barrels, but tanks can generally use leashes or death from above instead) +2000 kill the Bloodfang Hydrath (BAM #1) +2500 kill the Darkheart Juggernaut (BAM #2) +3000 kill Emberhorn Fangspawn (BAM #3) +4000 kill Kaidin (BAM #4) +100 knock down a teralith +1500 leave the teraliths alive upon platform completion (awarded per teralith alive, so max is 4500 for leaving all three alive) +5000 clear the platform without letting the center crystal break +3000 keep crystal health above 75% (if no message appears saying the crystal is starting to crack, you\u0026rsquo;re good) +35000 complete the platform with more than five minutes to spare (for every additional second over five minutes, another +50 points are added) -2500 let the center crystal break TANK should grab aggro as soon as possible from the hydrath that just spawned at the northeast.\nRemember that the center crystal is constantly generating aggro, so an orange aggro circle isn\u0026rsquo;t enough, you\u0026rsquo;ll likely need to go through your rotation as you kite him to keep its attention. Get the aggro you need (usually enough attacks to get it down to 90% health) before luring it to the barrels on the northern side of the platform.\nBring it within range of two or three of the barrels before leashing/death from aboving the barrels (lancer tanks should make sure you are out of range of the barrels, warriors can just death from above the barrels since the invulnerability frames will keep you save). As soon as you\u0026rsquo;ve killed it, head to the southern spawn point and wait there jumping. DPS \u0026amp; HEALER should not interfere with this whole process and should instead congregate northwest, where the juggernaut will spawn.\nIt is the second BAM on the platform and will spawn immediately after the tank kills the first BAM. Drop your slows and damage as soon as it spawns in. Teralith 1 (northeast) will likely spawn in at this time, so when it does (there will be a notice on your screen), DPST should break off to go keep that teralith in permanent knockdown (be careful not to kill it, cast only your knockdown skill as it goes off cooldown). Once the juggernaut is dead, have the rest of the DPS join DPST up on the northeastern side and just wait there jumping (you\u0026rsquo;ve been doing that throughout this entire dungeon right?), only helping out the DPST if the teralith gets outside the spawning area.\nThe HEALER should wait at the northwestern spawn for the second teralith. DPST should make sure you do your best to knockdown the teralith so that it gets knocked back to the edge of the platform, as the last BAM will be spawning in that location, and you don\u0026rsquo;t want to accidentally kill the teralith with your bigger aoe skills if possible.\nThe third BAM, a fangspawn, will spawn south as soon as the juggernaut dies.\nHave the TANK grab as much aggro as possible as soon as it appears (you might need to go through your full aggro rotation once or twice, this one is very picky). Once it\u0026rsquo;s onto you, kite it to thesouthwestern barrels and hurt it with the explosion (try and get it within range of around 4 barrels, as the number of barrels that explode near it affect how much health it loses; 4 will push it below 50% health). This won\u0026rsquo;t be enough to kill it, so grab a bit more aggro then kite it to thesoutheastern barrels to finish it off (go for at least 4 barrels in range again, mandatory if you weren\u0026rsquo;t able to do so with the first set). Once it\u0026rsquo;s dead, immediately head to the northeastern spawn to help kill the final BAM and/or help knockdown the first teralith. HEALER should be using their knockdown skills to keep the second teralith that spawns northwest in permaknockdown (doesn\u0026rsquo;t hurt to swap a glyph out for decreased cooldown if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already).\nOnce the third teralith spawns south, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to juggle knockdowns between the two. Use sleeps, stuns, and slows as necessary. Always keep an eye on both teraliths and hope your damage dealers and tank can kill the final BAM before both teraliths reach the middle. Remember that teraliths gain knockdown resistance each time they are knocked down. A good tactic is usually to spam knockdowns on the second teralith until you\u0026rsquo;re notified that the third teralith has spawned in. Wait for the second teralith to get up from your last knockdown and sleep it before running over to the third teralith and knocking down that one a few times until your first sleep wears off (click on the teralith so you can keep track of this!).\nAt that point you can use your own judgment when juggling teraliths. DPS \u0026amp; TANK should be wailing on the last BAM up northeast as soon as it spawns; throw all the slows and endurance debuffs you can onto it, and always keep them stacked. DPST should be bouncing back and forth between the BAM and his/her teralith at this point unless it becomes clear that there won\u0026rsquo;t be enough damage to finish the last BAM off before it reaches the center.\nThe same goes with the tank and his/her teralith if the healer is only dealing with the second. If the healer has no problem dealing with the second and third teraliths alone, it\u0026rsquo;s usually a good idea for the TANK to take over knocking down the first teralith so that the DPST can join the other DPS in killing the last BAM. Once the fourth BAM is dead, THE WHOLE PARTY should continute jumping and knocking down teraliths (they can still destroy the crystal if they get too close) until the platform finishes and the crystal disappears.\nDO NOT HEAD UP THE RAMP TO THE FINAL PLATFORM, as stepping onto the final ramp will automatically start the last platform. Over the course of the platform, the barrels will respawn after they have been blown up.\nIf you have a warrior or mystic in your party and you have the time to spare, you can summon a shadow or a thrall and send it off to attack a set of barrels. Since these summons also count as monsters, you\u0026rsquo;ll still get the 1000 points from their deaths. Just make sure to verify with your tank which sets of barrels he/she doesn\u0026rsquo;t need anymore after some of the BAMs have died (in other words, you should NEVER destroy barrels with summons at the start of the platform).\nAlso, you obviously want to make sure no one is standing near them when you do send your suicide summons off to their deaths. Platform 3 Preparation On this final platform, there will be a BAM in the center attacking the center crystal (Barkud).\nHe does damage, so only venture onto the bridge leading to the platform once everyone is ready. There are also three shards on the edge once more, but this time they are surrounded by some mobs. These mobs do no damage, but can knock players down very easily. On this platform, you want to ignore these three shards and their respective mobs if at all possible. Barkud has high crit resistance, so decide beforehand whether to go crit or power depending on party composition.\nTANKS should note that it is important to both keep aggro on Barkud for the entirety of this platform, and get it back quickly at a moment\u0026rsquo;s notice. Tanking position is important, as Barkud loves to do forward and backward leaps that can sometimes hit the crystal if you aren\u0026rsquo;t careful.\nGet him as far away from the center and edge shards as possible before tanking Barkud laterally to the center crystal. For this platform, if HEALERS were going for the saving a party member at critical health bonus points, it is recommended that they no longer do so, as this boss hits way too hard for it to matter, and you\u0026rsquo;ll likely end up getting these points on accident anyway.\nFor dps warriors and healers up for a challenge, the warrior can strip his/her health away to below 5% health before going in.\nDefense Bonus Point Opportunities Points Action +500 kill one of the normal mobs that is near a shard +3000 kill one of the larger mobs that is near a shard +1500 kill the little ghost that comes out of a crystal shard on the perimeter when it breaks (avoid breaking these crystal shards in the first place, as the potential points you can get are higher) +1000 deal more than 500k damage to Barkud in a single hit +1000 hit Barkud with death from above while under 5% health (WARRIORS only, fairly risky, if the warrior is tanking don\u0026rsquo;t even think about it; also has a cooldown of around 30 seconds, so you can\u0026rsquo;t just spam it) +30000 kill Barkud within the time limit +2000 defeat Barkud with the help of the dragon\u0026rsquo;s fire breath debuff +5000 protect the center crystal without having to destroy any of the surrounding crystal shards +30000 complete all platforms successfully (all three center crystals on all three platforms intact) -5000 let the center crystal break This whole platform is about keeping aggro on Barkud, so the TANK should be the first to head in once everyone is ready.\nHave the tank immediately pull aggro and get Barkud away from the crystal. Tank him in a position away from both the center crystal and the contaminated shards off to the side, and be sure to hold the boss still as much as possible so your dps can wail on him. If you ever see messages appearing on screen, expect to lose aggro pretty soon and be prepared to pull aggro back quickly. Spam your aggro rotation and/or have all of your threat generating skills on cooldown when possible during this fight. DPS \u0026amp; HEALER should fight Barkud like any other BAM, and contribute stuns and slows as necessary to help keep him in place. If you feel that your point total isn\u0026rsquo;t high enough (at least 174,000 going into the third stage is ideal for rank 1) and you can sacrifice some damage, have one or two dps go over to the shards to kill the mobs around them, but NOT THE SHARDS THEMSELVES.\nRemember that these mobs deal no damage but have high knockdown capabilities. Breaking a shard will lose you the potential 5000 points, but each shard releases a ghost that can be killed for 1500, so you can earn back 4500 of the points lost. Breaking the shards will also give your party a minute-long damage buff each (one that you hopefully won\u0026rsquo;t need). THE WHOLE PARTY should watch out for the tells on Barkud. Other than the normal BAM attacks, Barkud has two sets of jumps that make it annoying to keep in place.\nFor instance, right after Barkud does a single ground pound with both fists, it will immediately jump backwards for a bodyslam, and then jump forwards twice as far. Another example would be after Barkud raises both fists in the air and pummels the ground for a while with the screen shaking; it\u0026rsquo;ll often do a forward jump right after. Depending on its positioning, you\u0026rsquo;ll want to either throw all the stuns you have at the right time or let Barkud jump further away to help with repositioning.\nAs mentioned before, the TANK\u0026rsquo;S priority should be to keep Barkud\u0026rsquo;s aggro on himself/herself and off of the crystal.\nOnce that\u0026rsquo;s no longer a problem, you can start thinking about where to position Barkud. Because of its forward and backward jumps, you want to make sure that Barkud doesn\u0026rsquo;t accidentally jump on top of either the center crystal or the surrounding shards. The best place to do so will be between two of the shards with the tank with his/her back against the edge of the platform.\nAt this distance, the backflip bodyslam move will not reach the center crystal, and you will be able to block both of the forward jumps without worrying about boss movement. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to keep up aggro though, since it\u0026rsquo;ll be bad if Barkud turns away from you and heads toward the center crystal. If Barkud is acting noncompliant, you can try tanking it laterally between the center crystal and one of the outlying shards. That way, if it does happen to jump forwards or backwards, it won\u0026rsquo;t jump onto any of the shards and you can try to force him up against the wall.\nBarkud hits hard. Very hard. Two or three of its attacks are enough to kill pretty much anyone in the party.\nIts bodyslams from jumps do an extraordinary amount of damage as well. Ranged damage dealers and healers should never stand directly behind or in front of the boss without any good reason unless they are familiar with the tells of the boss and can dodge away when necessary (I\u0026rsquo;ve seen plenty of clothies get one-shot in my time). Melee damage dealers should learn the tells as well, as the backwards jump will still hit you if you stay in the same place directly behind Barkud while dealing damage. It is important for all party members to stay alive at this point, as multiple deaths can push you down a rank fairly quickly.\nIf you brought potions along, now is the time to use them. Then again you should have been using consumables throughout this dungeon anyway. At below 10% health, Barkud will run to the center of the room next to the crystal and a dragon (Jermir!) will arrive.\nAs you approach this percentage (around 15%) you want to stop using any stuns and attacks that apply a slow, as you need Barkud to run to the center and make it in time to be breathed on by Jermir\u0026rsquo;s dragon breath. Keep up the damage if you wish but be sure to not use stuns and slows, and leave Barkud alive long enough so that the dragon can breath fire onto him. As soon as Barkud reaches the center, everyone should switch to ONLY normal attacks, since once Barkud gets hit with the dragon breath, it will be one-shottable, so use normal attacks from that point on to get both the dragon-assist bonus and the normal attack bonus. If you notice that Barkud doesn\u0026rsquo;t immediately die from your normal attacks after the dragon has breathed its fire and disappeared, you didn\u0026rsquo;t make it in time for the dragon-assist bonus, so just use skills some more before you normal attack finish it off so you at least get that bonus. If your party is comfortable with it and you have the time to spare, you can start to tank Barkud closer to the crystal when it gets near 10% so that it has more time to run to center for the dragon breath.\nRanking Rank 5: (1 to 49,999 points) x Yes, it is possible to fail a rank 5 with a negative score and get no rewards at all) Rank 4: (50,000 to 99,999 points) x Rank 3: (100,000 to 179,999 points) x Rank 2: (180,000 to 239,999 points) x Rank 1: (240,000 points and above) x Sources Tera4You SG Guide "},"title":"Sirjuka Gallery"},"/dungeon-guide/dungeon/sky-cruiser-endeavor-hard/":{"data":{"":"","first-boss-putrion#First Boss: Putrion":"","last-boss-darkan#Last Boss: Darkan":"","pre-fight#Pre-Fight":"","second-boss-perimos#Second Boss: Perimos":"","sources#Sources":"Pre-Fight Perimos will be firing lasers at random players, notified by ℹ️ Perimos is gathering power for an attack!” This does not follow players and is indicated by the purple secondary aggro circle. The tank should tank the mobs near Perimos, to make dodging lasers easier.\nFirst Boss: Putrion The tank should attempt to position the boss far from the gate, as certain attacks may cause Putrion to charge through the gate and reset.\nℹ️ He is quicker. Can still be knocked up / bullrushed. Mobs (archers and hulks) hurt a LOT. Stun them and focus. Special attacks Slash - Putrion will rise into the air and slash the ground in an AoE arc formation, 15m in front of him.\nYou can either stay far away or very close to avoid being hit. If hit, you will be receive damage and a stun effect. This can be cleansed. If stunned, Putrion will focus his next attack on you. Stun - Putrion will reveal a large red circle around him, indicating his next attack.\nIf caught, you will receive damage and a stun effect. This can be cleansed. If stunned, Putrion will focus his next attack on you. Charge - Putrion will charge at a player, noticeable by the purple ring, dealing damage by trampling over them.\nBarrage - Putrion will fly into the air and thrust forward after a short period, dealing frontal damage.\nSecond Boss: Perimos All players should attempt to stay in the middle of the room, to avoid the boss moving around too far for certain mechanics.\nℹ️ Crystals have 200k HP Lasers have been buffed. They deal 960k total damage. 5 people MUST GATHER or it will break the crystal. When a crystal gets destroyed he gains a 400M shield. Key Mechanics Aeonalis Pylons - A message will be announced saying:\nℹ️ Perimos is trying to destroy an aeonalis pylon!” Perimos will move to the center of the room and focus one of the stones located on the outer edge of the room.\nThere are 8 in total, the boss will attempt to destroy these stones with a laser. You and your party must stand inside the lasers range to decrease the damage these pylons receive. You will receive damage and a DoT debuff; your healer must cleanse and heal the party. If you fail to shield the stones and if all 8 break, your party will wipe. This laser is a purple color and is not to be confused with the boss’s normal laser attack. He’ll only do one purple laser at a time from 100% to 70% every 50 seconds. He’ll then proceed to do 2 consecutive purple lasers from 69% to 30% every 50 seconds. After 30%, Perimos will do two consecutive red lasers instead of one. The second one is aimed at the furthest player.\nSpecial attacks Laser - Perimos will attempt to laser a player, indicated by the purple ring, you must avoid this deadly attack. This laser is orange/yellow in color and is not to be confused with Aeonalis Pylons laser.\nHowever, you should move out of the way of any Aeonalis Pylons (do not stand between the boss and a stone if the laser is on you) as this laser can also damage the stones.\nThis occurs when Perimos says : ℹ️ Small things.. So bothersome.. I’ll kill.. ” You should iframe this laser as it cannot be blocked.\nBlast Wave - Perimos will use to inner energy to deal a wave of damage in a cone/arc formation. He’ll say :\nℹ️ Get back!” Dislocated Swipe - Perimos will remove his arm and use it as a weapon. He’ll swipe it side to side four times whilst moving forward.\nDislocated Slam - Perimos will remove his arm and use it as a weapon. He’ll slam against the ground and then proceed to slam it further into the ground four times.\nThe third one can hit players directly behind him while the fourth one does significantly higher damage. Web - Perimos will crouch and spawn webs on the floor around him. These webs will damage and debuff players with a heavy movement speed decrease.\nThis can be cleansed. Central Slam - If Perimos moves too far from the middle, he’ll slam his arm into the ground and jump towards the middle causing fatal damage to anyone near the middle.\nPerimos will shout “Pylons… So very fragile…” and destroy a pylon with either a Dislocated Swipe or a Web. Last Boss: Darkan The tank should aim to fight the boss in the middle, so mechanics such as DoT circles can be placed on the sides.\nℹ️ He is extremely fast. 1 Swipe is still iframable. When he kneels down, he applies a bleed and a root. Prevents usage of skills and slows you down. Gains a 5% attack speed and 3% power buff every 25% (on 75,50,25,10%) He gains 10minute buff on engage. Acts as a timer. Once it runs out its impossible to clear. At 25% he will put a 3minute bleeding debuff on every person. Bleeds for 7% every 2 seconds. Bleeds way more when fully buffed at 10%. Fire bleeding from his attacks is no longer cleansable. Stacks up. His secondary aggro will most likely kill you, its very fast. Ghosts have 2.5 bilion HP. They hit for 150k They MUST be stunned or you will have a bad time. Key Mechanics Rings of Fire - Darkan will rise into the air and create a circle cage. You must enter, anyone out of this cage will die when Darkan lands. The cage will split into 3 sections, inner, mid and outer.\nOne section will randomly become a danger zone (noticeable by red indicator), avoid this zone. This occurs 3 times before Darkan slams the ground, breaking the cage and dealing fatal damage to players outside (cannot be iframed, although you can use non-standard iframes such as Breakaway Bolt to survive). After the first Ghost phase, the rings will occur 4 times being Darkan slams the ground. In addition, 2 rings can be active at once. Darkan\u0026rsquo;s Servants - At 75% and 50% HP, Darkan will say :\nℹ️ The fire will consume you!” Then disappear and the room will turn red. A ghost will spawn, choose the player with the highest aggro, say :\nℹ️ (Player), you’ll die…” And proceed to chase and attack him/her with static damage until player dies. Once it spawns, healers should use a heal to generate aggro and proceed to kite the ghost.\nIf you do not kill it within the time limit, the party will take fatal damage and die. The 50% Minion phase will have 2 Minion’s instead of 1. Fire Wing - This mechanic is important to master. Darkan will slam the ground with his swords often.\nIf Darkan sword slams (his regular auto attack) with his Left sword (rear view), he will continue to slam the ground another 2 times then he will proceed with the Fire Wing. This mechanic will push you the edge of the map and applies fire bleeding effect.\nTo avoid getting hit you must pay attention to his swords. The 4th/final slam onto the ground determines the direction of the Fire Wing.\nDarkan can fire left or right and the direction is determined by which sword (left or right) is used for the 4th slam. If the left sword is fiery and against the ground (and the right sword in the air), then he will use his right wing and proceed the attack in the right direction. If the right sword is fiery and against the ground (and the left sword in the air), then he will use his left wing and proceed the attack in the left direction. Dodge This! - He will also do 3 consecutive Fire Wing without doing 4 consecutive slams. Each Wing is individual and may be left or right so it is important to pay attention to his swords.\nDarkan will say “I!” and proceed the first Fire Wing, then “Will!” and do the second, then finally “Obliterate you!” and then do the third. Enraged Darkan - Once Darkan passes 25% HP, he will shout :\nℹ️ I’ll show you true power!” He will enrage and deal more damage. This begins a three minute timer. Once the time limit passes, your party will wipe.\nDuring this period, he will be limited to only Basic Combos, Fire Wings, secondary aggro Empowered Strikes, and Sword Throws. Fire zone - At 94%, a fiery area will appear on the left and right of the room. At 54% and 25%, this area grows larger. Moving or getting pushed into these areas will instantly kill players.\nThese players cannot be revived with a Priest or Mystic Resurrection, but they can use a Goddess’s Blessing to walk out safely. Basic attacks Darkan will repeatedly use these combos throughout the fight: Fire Wing Turn - If Darkan attacks with his left sword (rear view/DPS view) first, he will proceed 2 consecutive normal attacks and then a Fire Wing.\nFire Swipe - If Darkan attacks with his right sword (rear view/DPS view) first, he will proceed with doing a normal attack with his left sword, do a Fire Swipe backwards, then do a Empowered Strike\nFire Charge - If Darkan attacks with 2 consecutive Empowered Strikes, he will proceed with 2 Fire Swipe backwards and then a Fire Charge forwards.\nSpecial attacks Empowered Darkan Fire Bleeding - Certain attacks will apply a debuff that ticks for a percentage of a player’s maximum HP.\nThis debuff cannot be cleansed. Fire Slam - Darkan will twirl into the air, your party must get at least 18m away from Darkan as he will proceed to slam the ground, causing fatal damage up to 18m.\nDarkan can cast this multiple times in a row, and he will usually precede this with a Backstep. Fire Circles - Darkan will sheath his swords and rise into the air.\nYour party should run to the edges as Darkan will place DoT circles on each player. You should attempt to avoid being hit by escaping just before the circles take root to avoid damage. Fire Charge - Darkan will spin and charge towards a player, causing damage. You will not be pushed. This is always used after a double Fire Swipe.\nSword Throw(Ressbait) - The boss will throw his swords and pull them back, leaving the ground scorched for a few seconds.\nIf a healer casts Resurrect, Darkan will shout : ℹ️ Your time is running out!” And throw his swords at the healer.\nScream - Darkan will throw his swords into the ground and scream, applying a cleanseable debuff that deals damage over time and silences players.\nThis can be blocked, although the attack will still deal damage. Healers can cast their cleanse right before the silence is applied to cleanse party members immediately. Empowered Strike - Darkan will empower his weapon, slam the ground, and then strike with enormous power, dealing massive damage and applying the fire bleeding debuff.\nSources Essential Mana Guide made by Yosha "},"title":"Sky Cruiser Endeavor (Hard)"},"/dungeon-guide/dungeon/temple-of-temerity/":{"data":{"":"","first-boss-kuma#First Boss: Kuma":"","second-boss-hermit-crab#Second Boss: Hermit Crab":"","sources#Sources":"\rWhen you first enter the instance you will notice a little fairy with a repeatable quest marker. Talk to him and obtain a potion.\nDO NOT USE YET. Just keep it in your bag. This potion lasts for 3 min and has a cooldown of 20 min.\nThis is used to negate the silencing effect in the boss room. Every 50 kills the team will receive a buff that will allow you to res on the spot.\nIf you somehow die, wait for this buff to appear. You cannot return to the dungeon if you res in town. When everyone is ready, have someone interact with the stone to start the timer. The objective is to protect the crystal in the middle from the mobs. The room to the right will spawn 3 mobs at set intervals.\nKill them, and at 21 kills the first boss will spawn. First Boss: Kuma This is a fairly easy BAM for most classes to handle. It may be best for a newer member or someone slightly undergeared to take him on.\nUse the potion from the fairy as you go in and once the 10 second silence wears off, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use skills again (or use the potion just before you enter the room so you won\u0026rsquo;t receive the debuff).\nYou have 3 min to kill the boss. If you have a Mystic in your group, they can assist by running in with the solo DPS for auras. If they\u0026rsquo;ve been dropping motes, your party should be fine without heals for 3 minutes at most.\nDuring this time, adds will continue to pour into the central room. The tank should taunt and allow the rest to kill the mobs.\nThey can hit pretty hard. Second Boss: Hermit Crab The second boss is the Hermit Crab (similar to Akasha or Thulsa). This should probably be taken care of by someone confident in killing this type of BAM.\nAgain, 3 min time limit to kill the boss. You can practice killing this type of BAM below. If you can down this guy without getting hit, it should help greatly.\nNote that this open world BAM has a sleep, while the one in ToT does not. IMPORTANT: Just before the second boss spawns (approx. 12 min mark), 4 adds that do not move will spawn by the boss room\u0026rsquo;s entrance.\nHave someone step in to pull them so they do not follow the person going in to solo the boss. Sometime inbetween the fight, the adds will disappear and barrels will summon. These barrels won\u0026rsquo;t hurt you.\nBreak them to kill the adds that appear. Third Boss: Arachen The third boss is an Arachen type. You should have seen it back in Sinestral Manor (last boss). This boss is taken care of by the tank, healer and the last DPS who usually is a ranged class.\nAll three will go in to down this boss; this boss can hit pretty hard. The red eye attack where it smashes its claws down will cause a bleed effect when hit.\nThis attack will hit both front and around it so melee should also dodge this. Spike Pad and the Gulas - The two DPS left will keep killing the adds with barrels. Depending on the timing, it will switch onto the last Gula phase. Spike pads will appear at both entryways with three switches.\nDO NOT TOUCH the Cataclysm Switch as it has a cooldown of 3 min and is necessary to stop the Game of Death. Wait in front of the room with the spinning lasers. As the Gulas approach the spike pads, someone will hit the switch right beside it to slow them down.\nWatch out for their bellyflop attack as it can take out a good chunk of your HP. Once the third boss is dead the instance will end.\nBut if you had only managed to kill the first two bosses, then you will need to keep going. At some point, a screen warning will appear about the Game of Death. Run over to the other side and activate the spike pad. Once you see that all the mobs have entered the room, hit the Cataclysm Switch to kill them. If you wait too long, they will put up a shield which makes them immune to the damage, so time it correctly or you may fail. Depending on how many bosses you have killed, you will get chests to spawn accordingly.\nSources Tera4You ToT Guide ","third-boss-arachen#Third Boss: Arachen":""},"title":"Temple of Temerity"},"/dungeon-guide/dungeon/thaumetal-refinery/":{"data":{"":"","first-boss-birchback#First Boss: Birchback":"","last-boss-cyrux#Last Boss: Cyrux":"","second-boss-lenim#Second Boss: Lenim":"","sources#Sources":"\rFirst Boss: Birchback Key Mechanics Bananas - During the run, a random member of party will have a banana on their head. This means that person will place a banana under them! That person must run near the tree ASAP.\nThere are two ways to tell when banana drops.\nDebuff timer will run out and banana will be placed. Banana icon above player’s head will turn yellow. I’ll kill all of you!! - Push-back Jump — He jumps almost immediately with this message.\nCannot block. You should iframe just before he lands to avoid DPS loss, or even possible death. When he lands, he will push you away very far, so you better run into the blue AoE quickly. Who’ll be my next toy?! [Name]… You’re next!! - Targets a random player. REMEMBER THE BANANA EARLIER?!\nThe person that is targeted must lure him on the banana near the tree. The actual mechanic is suppose to work in a way that you make him slip on banana to crash into the tree, but if the banana is very close to the tree and as long as you don’t lure him in a weird angle (not facing the tree), then he will slip away from the tree. Make sure you’re luring him right. Boss -\u0026gt; Banana -\u0026gt; Tree -\u0026gt; Target When he catches his target, he will stun everyone. This cannot be cleansed so don’t blame on healers. When he slips but miss the headbutt against the tree, everyone will be shot up in the air, receiving bleed debuff. This can be cleansed. Basic attacks Slap - He just slaps you once.\nRoll - He rolls on his side, it’s a multi-hit, but seems like only 2 hit (most of the time. Need confirmations.).\n2-hit combo - Quick shout with swipes then stamps. Nothing special.\nBackslide - If he looks like he’s gonna do some push ups, he’s gonna slide backwards.\nJump - Ignore the message pop up. He slams the ground then jumps in place. Both animations do hit you, but just block and you’re fine.\nIf he takes too long to jump, he’s going to throw a fart at you. It will inflict stun, but it can be iframed and cleansed though. Special attacks Multi-combo: 4-hit fisting followed by slam, then a jump. - Slam is blockable and iframeable but if you receive damage, it inflicts movement speed debuff which can be cleansed.\nJump cannot be blocked, but can be iframed. Stunning Slam - This is what Tanks must watch out for.\nInflicts stun You cannot block this attack so when he raises his hands in the air, you must iframe this. LEARN THE TIMING. Tanks may struggle with this. You can’t be too fast or too slow to iframe this– especially with attack speed buff differences.. Random target bombing - Targets a random party member throwing an AoE attack 3 times.\nIn Normal Mode, you just stay away from other party members. In Hard Mode, there will be a safe zone AoE (blue) under you after 3rd hit so run back to party behind the boss. That also includes Tanks, and you have no excuses as there are plenty of mobility without using iframes. Tri-Bomb AoE - When he initiate this attack, there will be 3 explosions before you need to figure out where the safe zone is. (refer to a diagram below)\nℹ️ Similar to Lakan, you can iframe into him to avoid this attack, but you can be pushed out of him if you attack or move. There are 3 possible pattern; ranged DPS or healers should take note in case they’re too far. Second Boss: Lenim Key Mechanics Shields and Crystal pillars - During the run, you will notice shields around the character and crystal spawning on people.\nIn Normal Mode, there will only be Red or Blue Shield. In Hard Mode. when the boss is below 50%, there will be Red, Blue, or White shield. Some party members will have an ore floating above their head. Similar to bananas, you will have a debuff timer which will tell you when you will place a crystal. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. You need these crystals to survive. In Normal Mode there will only be Green Crystal. There will only be Red or Blue lasers.\nIn Hard Mode, when the boss’ HP falls below 50%, the crystal will be Purple color instead. This is the signal telling you that the mechanic will have Red, Blue, and White lasers.\nTip for tank: Tank around the edge of the yellow circle of the map (see image).\nThe mechanic for this boss heavily relies on mobility, and being too close to the center is lethal. The edge of that circle is the sweet spot. Set #1 is the ideal position. The crystals are clearly visible apart from each other, it is not too close to where lasers come out, and distances of the crystals are not too far, making it easier to avoid lasers. Set #2 is terrible for two reasons: if the crystals are too close to each other, they may not be easily distinguished apart from each other. Also, another crystal is way too far from others, making it difficult to safely avoid lasers due to long distance travel. Classes lacking with mobility suffers greatest in this case. Set #3 is the worst case. Placing the crystal too close to where lasers come out means the laser may or may not switch immediately depending on the placement, and it’s hard to tell at glance. Lasers - Lasers appear with a message:\nEliminate all intruders. Eliminate all intruders.\rThis cannot be blocked or iframed. (but you can use Teleport Jaunt) At the center of the map there’s some structure. This structure shoots out lasers on two ends, which you can see by blue crystal pointing out from it.\nIt will rotate clockwise or counterclockwise based on the number of mechanic’s activation. Please read Take Note section to understand what to do here (especially tanks).\nEach time the laser passes through the crystals, it will change its color. To survive this mechanic, you must match the shield color with laser color. Same colors are Safe. Different colors are Dead.\nBelow 50%, laser color switch order is Red \u0026gt; Blue \u0026gt; White \u0026gt; Red \u0026gt; … when it passes the crystal. Basic attacks Front slam - Does as described, nothing special.\nBack Stomp - He turns around to stomp behind.\nDPS: TAKE NOTE that this does NOT mean his hitbox turns around, so no one should try to follow his back. Rock Smash - He pulls a rock from the ground without damaging the floor to slam it on the ground and smash it with his fist. When he slam the rock on the ground, the AoE does reach his behind, so melee DPS might need precaution.\nDouble Fisting - Nothing special. Blockable.\nSide Swipe - This attack can reach melee DPS behind, so take precaution when he pause after he throws a fist on the ground.\nSpecial attacks Stunning Combo - Stomp 4-hit swipes, Donut AoE, then Jumps for Circle AoE bomb.\nThe Jump attack cannot be blocked but it can be iframed. It also inflicts stun, but it can be cleansed. Buckshot - He spits out 3 rocks which inflicts bleed debuff which can be cleansed.\nThis is more of a threat for ranged or healers than tanks or melee. Rock Throw - Targets random player and throws a rock at them.\nLeap - If the person with aggro is too far, he will leap toward the aggro. This helps tank to reposition in some cases, but misuse of this mechanic can infuriate your party members.\nIn hard mode, you cannot block this attack… not that it hurts anyways. Red Rock - Cannot be blocked or iframed.\nHe miraculously pulls out a red rock without damaging the floor and a blue AoE will appear under a random party member.Simply get inside the blue AoE before its indicator is completely filled. In Hard mode, he might take his time causing the blue AoE to disappear before the attack. You can iframe the attack in this case. Time your iframe with the red AoE indicator. Blue Rock - Cannot be blocked, but it can be iframed.\nHe miraculously pulls out blue rock without damaging the floor. When he drops the rock, you will see blue AoE attack spreading out from him. In Hard Mode, he will also throw the rock, which reverses the direction of the blue AoE: it will now gather toward him instead. Last Boss: Cyrux The key mechanic for Normal mode is very different from Hard mode for this boss. So make sure you are reading the correct part. Key Mechanics Vaccinate the Goblins! - The dungeon has few things to take note of:\nGoblin mobs Red/Blue Vaccine Test tube colors Purple puddles. The catch here is that, during the run, you will notice Purple Puddles.\nThese puddles inflict some flat damage to players, but to goblin mobs, this is fatal to everyone in the party. The goblin will be infected by purple virus and self destruct after running toward a player, causing a massive AoE explosion. This cannot be blocked or iframed, and it also inflicts stun that can be cleansed. In Hard Mode, there will be a mechanic where you must create a pathway for the goblin instead of avoiding its pathway.\nIf the goblin do not have the pathway made for him, he will be infected and become a self destructing bomb. Contamination - With a message saying he’ll give you cancer, you get a contamination debuff.\nThis is indicated by a debuff icon or an orb floating above your head. This debuff means you must get hit by special mechanics corresponding to the color of debuff instead of avoiding it. Infection bomb - A red AoE will be placed under a random target. All party members should gather to share damage. After explosion, the debuff will be transferred to another player.\nScreech - With the message, he will begin to gather up energy. Stun him to prevent him from creating a ring of Aura.\nTouching this ring will inflict flat damage over time. Safe Pathway - With a message, a yellow puddle will be generated below players and a test chamber containing goblin mob.\nCreate a puddle bridge for the goblin mob toward a vaccine. The system message will tell you whether you should lead the goblin to blue or red. Cold = Blue Hot = Red Take note that the goblin is going to take the shortest route possible, so do not expect goblin mobs to follow a weird pathway. It will only travel in straight path. Hurry up! - Goblin will begin to walk faster than normal. This mechanic is a threat when your party had to split for the puddle path for goblin mobs.\nDispel the buff by throwing Plague of Exhaustion or using Regression on the goblin mob to remove their speed buff. Basic attacks Slash - Single hit slash. Self explanatory\nFront smash, Back kick - Smashes his flail on the ground and back kicks. DPS should take note that the kick pushes them back.\nEnergy Pulse - 2 hit attack. He gathers an energy on his hand, slaps it on the ground and inflicts another damage as he removes his hand. You can block both hits.\nDouble Flail Swing - Swings his flail twice on the person with aggro. Both hits can be blocked, but take note that the second hit might bleed.\nLarge Swing - Swings its flail at a large area about 10~20m donut AoE. This is only a threat to ranged DPS or healers, but it can be iframed if timed correctly (when flail starts to drag along the floor).\nDouble AoE - Initiates Donut first, then Circle AoE under everyone. An ideal strategy would be gather first, then iframe out of circle AoE, however, make sure you confirm that the AoE position is locked before doing so.\nHard Mode only. Special attacks Random target Flail - Throws its flail at a random target.\nPuddle Flail - When his flail glows purple as he swings it around, then this attack will leave a purple virus puddle when it successfully hits any entity, including HB, shadows, and thralls. This can be avoided by iframes.**\nDotted Lines - Depending on the boss’ test tube colors, this attack will be different. To make this easy, just remember:\nBlue is Between Red is Reversed In Normal Mode, both patterns appear consecutively one after another. In Hard Mode, it might do both patterns consecutively. It can only do one part and carry on. If you have contamination debuff, act accordingly. Huge Flail Swing - Based on the swinging direction, he will attack differently.\nIf he swings the flail clockwise, he will attack front. If he swings counterclockwise, he will attack behind. Normal, Blue, Red\nIf his back is normal, he will attack based on the direction of the flail. If his back is blue, he will attack based on the direction of the flail, then attack his front. If his back is red, he will attack based on the direction of the flail, then attack his behind.

This is where players must focus on the field, as well as the boss.\nThe drills will deal fatal damage and apply a harmful effect if you are hit by them. They activate at certain intervals of the fight:\n90% – Up to 3 Drills will activate and pierce the room. 70% – 4 Drills will activate and piece the room. 50% and below – A random amount of Drills will activate and piece the room. Players must avoid being hit by drills by standing infront of the non-active drills. Active drills will be noted by an orange danger zone and the actual drill will begin to rotate. Standing behind Agarta will protect players as well. Basic attacks Pincers - Agarta’s basic attacks involve her pincers. She will often use these to attack the player with the aggro and nearly all attacks will only do damage in front of her. She may alternate between her left and right pincer, or use combo attacks such as 6 consecutive blows or 1 large attack from above.\nSpecial attacks Roundhouse - Agarta will also use her pincers to deal damage whilst he spins, this will do damage to anyone close enough to the boss.\nBody Slam - During the fight, Agarta may jump into the air and slam the ground with great force, causing a shockwave of damage.\nPlayers who are near to Agarta when he makes contact with the ground will receive damage. Water Jet - Agarta will jet water in front of herself, dealing damage to any player who gets hit.\nPathway #2 Following the path to the second boss will lead you to more mechanics, involving debuffs and statues. The only way past is to defeat them in a particular way. Blue Statues and Priests - These statues emit a blue aura, entering this aura will cause players MP to be drained.\nPriests will begin spawning as you approach this statue which will debuff and reduce your endurance, up to 10 stacks. You must defeat this statue to proceed. Red Statues - These statues/pillars emit a harmful aura, entering this aura will cause you to take continual damage and reduced power/endurance.\nPlayer skills will not work on these statues, you must use normal/basic attacks to move the statues. Second Boss: Kornus Key Mechanics Red Statues - Similar to the statues you met in the pathway. These statues/pillars emit a harmful aura, entering this aura will cause you to take continual damage and reduced power/endurance.\nPlayer skills will not work on these statues, you must use normal/basic attacks to move the statues. Kornus will spawn these during the battle, announced by : ℹ️ Have you been enjoying my little traps?” Your DPS should push these out of the way so killing the boss is easier. Special attacks Weakened - Kornus likes to play with defense, he’ll shout\nℹ️ Do you really think my traps are my only trick?” And then will strike infront of himself.\nIf a player is hit, their weapon’s defense is reduced by 70%. Lancers and Warrior Tanks will need to worry about this as blocking hits with this debuff will proceed to drain Resolve quickly. Kornus will only use this on the player with the highest aggro. Leash - Kornus will begin to leash the statues to his location when his HP goes below 50%, your DPS will have to push them again. He’ll say :\nℹ️ It will take more than just pushing some statues around!” Strengthen - He’ll also shout\nℹ️ Let me show you an impenetrable defense!” Begin to cast a spell which increases his defense by 500. During the casting, he is immune to damage.\nYour healer has 7 seconds to cast their Regression (Mystic) or Plague of Exhaustion (Priest). This can stack up to 10 times, meaning 5000 extra defense. Charge - At 70% and below, Kornus will select one random member and charge in a straight line towards them.\nThis is notified by a danger zone on the ground and Kornus shouting : ℹ️ Die, you puny bugs!” Last Boss: Kaprima Reborn Key Mechanics Pentagrams - Kaprima will slam the ground with immense power, you must pay attention to either the words she speaks or the damage indicators as this will notify you whether the damage area is small, or large.\nIf the damage area is directly beneath Kaprima, in a small circle, she’ll say: ℹ️ Irritating pests…! I shall exterminate you!” If the damage area is a larger area around Kaprima, she’ll say: ℹ️ Vermin! I will wipe you out… all of you!” Getting hit will cause you to take on “Curse of Kaprima” which applies a damage over time debuff, as well as increases damage received by Kaprima by 30% for 15 seconds.\nCursed Ritual - Kaprima will retain her wipe mechanic, after announcing :\nℹ️ What’s the meaning of this? You leave me no choice” She will carry out her ritual. This involves Kaprima heading to the center of the room and begin to cast a deadly spell. The room’s floor will be covered in pentagrams. A player will then be chosen at random, they will be stunned and have a small circle zone around them. A few moments later, that player will be encased in a snake head, shielding them from Kaprima’s ritual and escaping death. In order for the other players to survive, they must quickly move themselves and stand inside this small zone before the snake head appears, so that they are encased as well. If players fail to enter the snake’s head before it rises, players can attempt to iframe the ritual.\nFor example Sorcerer can use Stone Skin. Special attacks Leash - Kaprima will walk towards the middle of the room, saying :\nℹ️ There is no other way…” Before leashing all players in. She will proceed to do the close-ranged Pentagram Damage Circles - Kaprima will target a player with a red circle which will follow them until just before it deals damage, you must use your evasive skills or block to avoid being hit.\nScythes - Kaprima will use her scythe to deal deadly blows in different formations, whether this is from behind, above, below or all around, everyone should be careful.\nKaprima will sometimes shouts ℹ️ Dodge this!” And then proceeds with roundhouse swipe, knocking players back and inflicting a deadly bleed. Eruption - Following one of her Scythe attacks, Kaprima may inflict damage in the form of an eruption.\nThis will be a direct line of damage in front of her. Fire Triplets - Kaprima creates 3 Fire Orbs with her hands and then fires them at a player, dodge them to avoid damage.\nSources Essential Mana "},"title":"Vault of Kaprima"},"/dungeon-guide/dungeon/wonderholme/":{"data":{"":"","#":"","boss-bandersnatch#Boss: Bandersnatch":"","boss-felbane#Boss: Felbane":"","boss-one-eyed-jack#Boss: One-Eyed Jack":"","kagrom#Kagrom":"","morgak#Morgak":"","sources#Sources":"\rEnterance You’ll encounter a miniboss near the entrance, Mock Lobster.\nMock Lobster summons caiman minions that rush in from both exits of the terrace. These shouldn’t be hard to deal with as you hit the miniboss. Watch out if they aggro on weak party members.\nA few other attacks to watch out for:\nWhen Mock Lobster says “Obey me!” he will stun nearby party members. When he says “Die!” he’ll do 3 AoEs of increasing size that apply a bleed debuff with each hit. When he says “C’here! I’ll take you down!” he’ll focus a series of attacks in front of him He usually gets a shield during some of these attacks that increases his endurance and makes him immune to harmful effects such as endurance debuffs. This shield can be removed by using Plague of Exhaustion or Regression, though it can also be easily ignored as it only lasts around 10 seconds.\nAfter Mock Lobster is dead, you can continue further upstairs to encounter Groop, another miniboss. He isn’t anything special and shouldn’t give your raid any trouble, especially if there are classes capable of making him airborne, where he can be juggled safely.\nWhen he’s dead, proceed and kill the mobs in the hallway to open the gate to the Great Hall.\nGreat Hall The Great Hall is divided in two by a closed fence. The miniboss Lutwidge will retreat to the other side where he can’t be harmed for now. On your side there will be a bunch of mobs and four stone pillars.\nThese stone pillars will keep spawning mobs and your raid must deal with them. The archers from the second floor might aggro on the people below and can focus fire on a single target, healers must be vigilant.\nAfter killing the mobs spawned by the stone pillars a few times, the gate to the second floor will open. Half of your raid should head up while the other half stays down dealing with the mobs that will keep spawning. The raid leader can organize the raid in party 1 and party 2 and choose which party will go up. It’s recommended to have one healer in each party.\nThe party that goes up will have to kill mobs as they advance until they reach the other side of the Great Hall. A stone monument is found there, destroying it will open the fence that divides the room and make Lutwidge lose his immunity to damage, and no more mobs will spawn from the pillars. Any mob that is still alive will receive a 200% Power buff, so you might want to wait until they are dead.\nAfter the stone monument is destroyed, everyone should be careful with Lutwidge’s hard hitting attacks.\nWatch out when Lutwidge says “You’re outnumbered!”, he will fear any party member standing near him. This can be cleansed. If he says “My blood is pumping–I’ll show you real pain!” he will swing his axe for hard hitting attacks to everyone close to him. When he’s dead, a shortcut teleportal will appear. Deciding to not take the shortcut grants you chance to encounter minibosses with special loot - you can check them HERE\nSewer Pits (optional) However, to cross and make it to the other side, you must first kill the three mini-bosses below to activate the lever and move the platforms.\nThe first miniboss is on the left side after you go down the stairs.\nIt summons an AoE when engaged that lingers until it dies (if it disappears, it will recast it). He can also stun party members by summoning lightning. The second miniboss is on the right side of the map.\nShe can summon copies of herself. The third miniboss is on on the right side as well, but in the corner.\nHe can stun party members and spawn a totem that shoots lasers at a short range. Afterwards, you can kill the mobs in the center and activate the lever.\nNow, test your platform jumping abilities and make it across!\nTwo-Ring Circus You arrive here from the shortcut teleportal in the Great Hall, or after crossing the Sewer Pits. You’ll have to kill some trash mobs as you approach the main area.\nThere are two cages in this room with a BAM inside each one, Morgak and Kagrom.\nThey must die within 20 seconds of each other or they will respawn, so you have to divide your raid in two parties keeping in mind strengths and weaknesses. If a boss is dying much faster than the other, the party should hold their DPS until the other party catches up. It’s a good idea to wait on the last HP bar. Pull the levers near each cage to open them and engage the bosses. Ranged classes and healers can stay outside but this is not recommended. The levers can be used again if anyone left outside needs to enter the cages.\nMorgak Morgak has fast hard hitting attacks and can stun.\nHe can also aggro on a random player with a ranged attack indicated by a red circle locked on the player, which causes damage and a movement speed debuff. Lastly, he can summon a minion or two from time to time that hopefully shouldn’t be a threat. Its recommended placing your main tank here to maintain most of his dangerous attacks away from your DPS and healer.\nKagrom Kagrom is slower than Morgak, making a tank less necessary, but he still hits hard.\nPlayers should watch out for his tail attack and for his curl. Kagrom can also shoot lasers and summon poison pools by locking on party members. The poison pools linger for a little bit, and he can place them on Morgak’s cage as well.\nWhen both bosses are dead within 20 seconds of each other, a shortcut teleportal will appear that will take you to the Beaminous Plateau.\nDeciding to not take the shortcut grants you chance to encounter minibosses with special loot - you can check them HERE\nFollybridge (optional) Upon arriving, sometimes you’ll get a message saying Master Keye has appeared in the area. He will be downstairs. This is completely random and some runs won’t have him appear. Killing Master Keye will activate a “mystical shortcut” platform accessible only with Teleport Jaunt (Mystics and Sorcerers) along the left wall of the room.\nBy using it you can reach a master lever that will activate the rest of platforms without having to use the levers below.\nIf Master Keye doesn’t appear or no classes with Teleport Jaunt are present to make use of the mystical shortcut, some people in your party will have to go downstairs and activate several levers. There are some suicide bomber mobs and snakes. The snakes can leash players towards them and stun them for a few seconds with a bleed debuff.\nDon’t forget to check for Bandergrub if everybody has been ignoring the shortcut teleportals. Like Master Keye, he spawns downstairs, and he will be at the back of the room between the platforms with the master lever and the exit.\nBandergrub is a small version of the last boss, Bandersnatch, with similar attacks but none of the major mechanics. When you finish your business here and the moving platforms are activated, go back upstairs and just follow them. It shouldn’t be hard to figure out! Hopefully.\nBeaminous Plateau Before reaching One-Eyed Jack you have to take care of some more trash mobs along the way, as well as a miniboss, Monument of Pain. This should give you no trouble at all, its only attack is a spinning laser which you can iframe through or just avoid by moving.\nIf your raid has been ignoring the shortcut teleportals, Belmun might spawn. Just as you reach the stairs leading to Monument of Pain, instead of going downstairs look to the hallway to the right. Belmun spawns there. He’s a skeletal general with an entourage of mobs.\nBoss: One-Eyed Jack Besides his normal attacks typical of any cyclops BAM (such as the final boss of Channelworks), there are some mechanics to keep in mind:\nPlayroom Balls - When Jack runs to the center of the room (though sometimes he can get stuck) and says :\nℹ️ Rollin’ rollin’ rollin’!” Balls will come out of all the holes in the wall. Each one of these balls provide a party-wide stackable Power buff.\nFailing to break a ball before it reaches the spikes on the other side of the room will summon several minions, including suicide bombers, that will flock to the raid. The first round of playroom balls happens shortly after the fight starts and only one wave of balls will spawn. Afterwards, every time this mechanic is repeated will have three waves of balls. Raids with high DPS may choose to ignore this mechanic and deal with the adds as they come, but it’s generally recommended to deal with this mechanic.\nJack’s Stun Ball - Jack will pick up a ball and stop briefly.\nHe will then either smash it on the ground at his feet or throw it away at a distant party member. Getting caught in the ball’s area of effect will stun party members (cleansable). This attack can be iframed or blocked. AAAARGH! - Jack will shout:\nℹ️ AAAARGH!” After a few seconds he’ll release an attack that generally only hits one player (usually the tank) despite what the AoE suggests.\nIf the player gets hit, they will be stunned and bleeding, which cannot be cleansed. Healers need to heal through the duration of the debuff. Jack will usually do this attack twice in a row, focused on the same player, so watch out.\nFire breath - Jack will secondary aggro a raid member and release a long-range fire breath attack. It leaves an AoE on the floor but it dissipates very quickly.\nAttack speed buff - If the fight takes a while, Jack will begin getting attack speed buffs that stack.\nIf it becomes overwhelming this is a sign that your raid’s DPS is low, and in that case dealing with the playroom balls mechanic efficiently will help in avoiding this situation. Aliss’s Lab After dealing with trash mobs, you’ll reach Aliss’s Lab. This room contains a lever that takes you to the next boss fight and a cell with an Imprisoned Smuggler that will drop two Manxome Draughts (with 100% Joy of Partying buff).\nThese Manxome Draughts cannot be traded and are bind on pickup. Without them, only one raid member can enter Felbane’s cage and fight him, because anyone inside the cage will have a debuff that will stun nearby party members.\nThe Manxome Draughts offer immunity to that, so two party members can fight if they use them (or more if anyone happens to have leftovers from previous runs).\nYou’ll want your strongest raid members to roll on the draughts, a tank and a DPS is recommended.\nWhen your raid is ready, pull the lever!\nSolonesome Cage Boss: Felbane Felbane is a Teralith with the standard attacks of that BAM type and nothing special, but the circumstances make for a rather particular boss fight. You could say the real boss is the room itself. Pull the lever to start!\nSiege weapons and mobs - When your raid pulls the lever, you have a few seconds to take positions.\nThe raid members that will not fight Felbane directly need to enter the siege weapons (tanks) and kill the mobs with them.\nFelbane is immune to siege weapon fire, for now. The mobs will rush towards the cage with Felbane in it, making the boss more difficult.\nThere are 8 siege weapons surrounding the cage. These should be taken to the entrance and exit of the room, upstairs, and used to shoot constantly at the base of the bridges leading to Felbane’s cage. Most mobs should die in this way, with few if any leaks.\nℹ️ Mystics in siege weapons can park right at the gate of Felbane’s cage and shoot from there. Their aura will work with the party members fighting Felbane. Fighting Felbane: Manxome Draughts - Party members with a Manxome Draught should drink it before entering Felbane’s cage and fight the boss carefully, especially if there is no healer.\nIf for any reason nobody has a Manxome Draught, only one person can go inside and fight solo. Felbane’s HP regeneration - At 20% HP left the boss will lose its immunity to siege weapon fire and start regenerating his HP constantly.\nFelbane loses immunity to siege weapons...\rThere are a few different ways of dealing with this, but the most obvious and main one is for the players in the siege weapons to ignore mobs and focus all their fire on the boss, while the players inside the cage continue dealing damage.\nIf the fire power is not enough, the whole raid can abandon their tanks and go inside the cage to fight Felbane directly, trying to burn through the HP regen (the stun debuff will not be active at this point).\nIf that’s still not enough, the raid can wait for the HP regen buff to run out and then finish the boss off. Sometimes he will receive a Fiery Rage buff during this phase (Power increased by 1000%, attack speed increased by 10%), which makes fighting Felbane directly much harder.\nKill Count - If the fight drags on, reaching certain mob kill milestones will award raid-wide buffs that will aid those who are fighting Felbane.\nNote on wiping:\nIf the raid wipes on this boss it is possible to run into a glitch where the boss doesn’t reset properly and mobs keep spawning. To fix this, have your whole raid except one person go outside the dungeon. The person who remained inside needs to go in the cage with the boss and be killed by it. This should reset the whole boss fight and make mobs stop spawning.\nAfter this, if the caiman with the Manxome Draughts doesn’t spawn again, the raid will need to send the strongest or most reliable party member to fight the boss solo while everyone else deals with the mobs. Since in that case there will be 9 party members outside but only 8 siege weapons, a Mystic can toss motes inside the cage from outside to aid the soloer if necessary.\nOnce victory is yours, you will reach a room with a stone pillar in the center, surrounded by lasers and trash mobs. You can destroy it there, but it will be more dangerous. Instead, classes with skills such as leashes and bullrush can bring the pillar to the safe zone near the gate.\nMockinghall Boss: Bandersnatch The Bandsnatch is the final boss of the Wonderholme raid. It is a pretty large BAM with somewhat of an odd hitbox.\nUncleansable poison -A number of Bandersnatch’s poison-themed attacks cause a poison debuff that cannot be cleansed.\nIf hit by it, healers will need to keep healing until the debuff runs out. Bandersnatch\u0026rsquo;s Staff - Bandersnatch can use his staff for two quick swings or to smash it on the ground.\nGenerally aimed at the tank. It can be blocked or iframed. Tail Sweep - Bandersnatch can sometimes spin 360º for a quick tail sweep.\nThis can inflict a cleansable bleeding debuff. Vomit Breath - Bandersnatch will lower its head and vomit, hitting for several ticks of damage.\nThis attack is usually directed at the tank and can be blocked. “Rear attack” - Bandersnatch will pinch its nose and then release an attack from its rear.\nThis is similar to the vomit breath attack but focused on the party members behind. Clockwise poison pools - Bandersnatch will raise its tail while placing its face against the floor, and drop poison pools around in a clockwise manner.\nThe boss usually slides towards the tank (might push them) while doing this attack, but it can also secondary aggro someone else and push towards them. There will be circle indicators so you can see the attack coming. These pools don’t linger. They can be iframed and blocked. Focused poison pool - Bandersnatch will adopt the same stance as with the clockwise poison pools and lock on a random party member with a big circle.\nWhen the circle’s border turns blue and yellow, you must get out of it fast. A pool will form for a few seconds, and getting hit by it will root you in place while the pool damages you. The immobility debuff can be cleansed. Petrification Spit - Bandersnatch will regurgitate, then release a ball of spit that turns whoever gets hit into stone.\nThis can’t be blocked, but can be iframed or walked out of before it hits. Generally aimed at the tank, and often done twice in a row. The stone debuff can be cleansed. Dizzy poison jump - Bandersnatch will generate a green poison mist, then jump and release a poison AoE upon landing.\nThis attack will stun and poison party members and apply a dizzy/drunken effect on screen. The stun can be cleansed but the screen effect will stay for a bit. The attack can be iframed and blocked. Sleep Curl - Beginning at 90% HP, Bandersnatch will curl for a couple seconds and then release a dark mist that sleeps party members. This can be iframed and blocked, or simply avoided by distancing yourself.\nHealers need to cleanse asleep party members as soon as possible and run for safety for the following mechanic. This attack repeats aproximately every two minutes followed by Green Lights, and is forced at 50% and 30% followed by Cursed Color Totems.\nℹ️ Priests can use Guardian Sanctuary for immunity to sleep in case they have trouble iframing or staying away. They can use it to purposefully get hit and then cleanse immediately as they’ll be likely to cleanse everyone who got hit. Green Lights - After Sleep Curl, the room will go dark and green light circles will appear somewhere in the outer area of the room.\nA speed buff is provided to the raid. Run inside the biggest green circle and wait next to the immediately smaller one. Move towards the next circle from biggest to smallest with each green flash of light. Mistiming this or going to the wrong circle will one shot you. ℹ️ It’s possible to iframe the one shot, or use certain skills such as sorcerer’s Warp Barrier. Bandersnatch will not be immune to damage during this phase, so it’s possible to get some extra DPS in before running to the circles. Cursed Color Totems - At 50% and 30%, Bandersnatch will do Sleep Curl. Then it will summon 4 totems in different colors in the room and retreat to the ceiling where it can’t be damaged anymore.\nEveryone will receive a sequence of 4 debuffs, the same ones for the whole raid, with different colors and numbers, corresponding to the totems and the order in which they must be activated. Run as a group, and wait for the totem to cleanse your debuff (a speech bubble from the totem will indicate it), then run to the next one and so on. Once finished, wait away from the center of the room until Bandersnatch lands from the ceiling. If caught inside the AoE caused by the landing, you will die. Doing the sequence in the wrong order will curse and kill whoever is inside the totem, even those doing the sequence correctly. It’s possible to avoid death if you get out of the totem quickly.\nKnockdown Phase - From time to time (aproximately every 20% HP) Bandersnatch will say :\n⚠️ You can’t run from me!” And an orange aura will appear. The boss will do nothing for a few seconds while this happens.\nParty members need to focus on trying to knock down or stagger the boss.\nIf failed, it will pull the whole raid and release a very big poison pool that will linger for a while, which causes high damage and gives less room for DPS or for dealing with mechanics until it disappears. Secret Minibosses By not using the shortcut teleportals, you gain a chance (random spawn) of encountering two minibosses, Bandergrub and Belmun. Attempting a full run and forbidding the usage of shortcut teleportals needs to be communicated very clearly before starting, as raids tend to use the shortcuts.\nBandergrub is located at Follybridge (after Morgak and Kagrom), downstairs where all the snakes and levers are, at the back of the room.\nIt’s a minicopy of Bandersnatch with similar attacks but none of the major mechanics. Belmun is located right before you reach the miniboss Monument of Pain. Belmun is a skeletal general surrounded by some mobs.\nBefore you go downstairs, there is a hallway with a dead end to the right. He spawns there. If the shortcuts are used at any point these minibosses will despawn.\nSources Essential Mana "},"title":"Wonderholme"},"/dungeon-guide/extreme/":{"data":{"":"\rℹ️ Select a dungeon to learn more!

This version of Dreadspire has 10 Floors, on each floor you wil fight a single boss.\nEach of these bosses are buffed up versions of the same boss we’ve seen before from hard modes/raids/previous DS. The biggest difference is that when your party wipes, you do not just go back in and try again where you left off. In this dungeon, if your party fails you get teleported out of the dungeon and will have to start over.\nOnly if you have another entry tho, you lose your entry when you fail. The ways in which you can fail by are :\n⚠️ Your party all dies. You did not meet the timer. You failed one of the main boss mechanics. An important part about this dungeon is that each boss usually starts with one of their most annoying attacks the moment they spawn. Another difference between normal dungeons and Dreadspire is the fact that you constantly have a debuff that reduces your HP every 2 seconds, depending on how far into the run you are. ℹ️ Stage 1 – 3: 5% per 2 seconds\nStage 3 – 6: 7% per 2 seconds\nStage 7 – 9: 9% per 2 seconds\nStage 10: 10% per 2 seconds THIS GUIDE WILL NOT HAVE BASIC ATTACKS EXPLAINED\nCounting in that you already know basic patterns of these bosses. Floor 1: Akasha Akasha is your typical Crab BAM type.\nSpecial attacks Mindblast - Not blockable, AoE\nYou can recognize this by her eyes glowing red. Poison - Not blockable, AoE\nYou can recognize this by the boss lifting up her butt, followed by eyes glowing red. Charge and Spin - The boss either charges twice to the front or he backsteps.\nFollowed by a spin that hits the back, and then the front. Getting hit by this spin will cause a knock back and then the boss will target someone who got hit. Key Mechanics Army - A text indicator will show up on the screen saying:\nℹ️ Akasha summons a large army.” This mechanic happens every 20% hp, starting at 90%. Akasha will then summon a lot of baby spiders. To deal with this mechanic the healer should cast a few heals so that the baby spiders aggro onto them, then the DPS and healer should kill them. Using a Sky Lotus Drink will make you immune to these staggers and allow you to walk/iframe away from these spiders. Clone Mechanic - The boss will gain a buff that needs to be removed by stunning the boss.\nThere’s a 3 second time period to stun the boss, failure to do so will cause the boss to summon 3 clones of herself. Which will then do one of the 3 attacks listed under Special Attacks. All of these attacks can be iframed but stunning is just that much easier. Floor 2: Baphomet This is just a reskin of Kaprima from Vault of Kaprima or Broken Prison.\nMain Pentagram attack does 100% of your HP as as damage. Which means that with kaia/thrall of protection you can live. When this boss is enraged, all of his attacks do significantly less damage. Around half the damage he does compared to when he’s unenraged. Special attacks Double Tap - Baphomet hits the tank by slamming the back of his weapon on the ground.\nFollowed by a not blockable, but iframable attack in front of the boss. Breath into Spin - Baphomet breathes something on the tank and then puts his weapon down to spin behind him\nTankbuster - Baphomet’s eyes glow red, followed by a swipe to the front.\nFollowed up by a strong attack in the front that’s blockable but does bleed, iframe to the side on the second attack. When the boss is enraged, this last attack can be blocked and it will barely hurt. Baphomet often follows up this attack by doing the above mentioned Double Tap. Key Mechanics Snakehead - Baphomet will give someone a debuff that lasts 10 seconds, when these 10 seconds it will spawn a Snakehead on that person.\nEnrage: Closest\rNon Enrage: Furthest Away\rGetting stuck in a Snakehead will deal constant damage to you and you will not be able to move out, giving you the following debuff: These snakeheads will be used for the next mechanic, but because these two mechanics don’t line up after another.\nComplete - A text message will show up on the screen saying:\r⚠️ Finally, all is complete”. This pentagram attack can be avoided by standing behind the Snakehead, by the word “behind” we mean having the Snakehead in between you and Baphomet. This attack does 100% of your hp as damage, which means that if you have a shield you can survive this attack without getting behind the Snakehead. Donut - A text message will show up on the screen, either he says “You are nothing to my power” or “Worthless…”\nJust like other Kaprima bosses, he does either a small or a big AoE(where close it safe) around him. Iframe when he’s about to stomp his foot on the ground.\n\u0026quot;You are nothing to my power!\u0026quot; Safe close to the boss.\r\u0026quot;Worthless...\u0026quot; Not safe near him.\rYou are nothing to my power!\rWorthless...\rLeash pull - Kaprima will fly backwards and then pull everyone into him. If after this animation ends someone is stunned by the pull he will do a whirlwind attack.\nIf you can cleanse yourself using brooch or a healer cleansing fast then you can avoid the whirlwind attack Failed\rIframed\rFloor 3: Dakuryon The main difference between the old Dakuryon and the new one is that he will do 4 swipes no matter what.\nDuring the “Gathering Power” mechanic he gains attack speed as well as attack damage the lower hp he is. This makes stuff like his swipes a lot faster. Special attacks Circles - Compared to the old circles, this one goes under every single party member.\nThis is also the ress bait on this boss so you want to avoid doing this because it requires our entire party to reposition and iframe. Thrust - This is the mechanic he starts the boss fight with.\nSometimes he will do a backstep after this followed by the same attack. More Power\u0026hellip; - The boss gets down on the ground and says “More… I need… more power”\u0026hellip;\nThis happens every 25% of the boss fight, so 75%, 50% and 25%. The boss gets significantly faster and stronger as these buffs stack up. Swipes - The boss starts spinning his sword around and then does swipes. With a text message saying\nℹ️ I will rip you apart!” If you’re familiar with the old swipes then it’s not that much different, except that it will always do 4 swipes. You can tell which side he’s gonna swipe by which side he holds his weapon, or by how he places it down. He either places it down vertically or diagonally.\nFrom the back it’s easy to tell cause you just go to the side where the back side of his weapon is, he might do back slam but you can iframe this.\nFrom the front, if he places his weapon down diagonally then you go to the right and expect a front slam and if he places it down vertically you go to the left side.\nHe will swipe every side once.\rOnce he does certain swipe you know it won’t happen again. Key Mechanics Retargeting - The boss smashes his weapon down twice in a row and after the second hit he will target the one closest to him and put a debuff on them.\nTaking this debuff twice will kill said person. Make sure to rotate this debuff around. Pizza Cage - The boss will summon mobs around the map, followed by the cage mechanic.\nFailure to kill these mobs will cause them to change into mobs that shoot annoying balls around the map. Blood Cage - There will be a text indicator on the screen saying:\nℹ️ Dakuryon uses the power of the Bloodshard!” The boss smashes his weapon down twice in a row, just like on the retargeting mechanic.\nInstead of putting a debuff on someone, he’ll go into his cage same as the Pizza Cage mechanic. This cage is slightly different from the cage that people are used to.\nWhile the patterns are the same as the old cage as well as the tells, which won’t be covered here.\nYou now gain 5 debuffs on your debuff, each having either a red or a blue color. Each representing one of the 5 hits of the cage. You have to do the cage according to the debuffs colors you have.\nIf you have a Red debuff you get hit by the red area.\rIf you have a Blue debuff you avoid the red area.\rFloor 4: Meldita The way to tell most of Melditas basic attacks is by looking at his “arms” the way he moves next to his body are the tells for his atacks.\nThe main priority for this boss is dealing with the worms effectively as soon as they spawn. We’ll go over these in Key mechanics. Special attacks Front Back (big) - Meldita attacks the front and then throws a big aoe behind itself.\nFront Back (multiple small) - Meldita attacks the front and then throws multiple small aoes behind itself.\nTargeting - Meldita targets a player and after a slight delay, throw an AoE at them.\nYou can tell the timing by when Meldita opens his eyes and goes into the spin. Iframe when he opens his eye. Laser - Meldita targets the furthest player and starts charging a laser.\nThe timing for the iframe is when Meldita opens like a clam, his sides begin expanding. If you are a healer and don’t know the timing for this mechanic, you can get far away from the boss and outrange it. Circles and Donuts - Meldita gets on his feet and uses expanding donuts around itself, this is not lethal but iframing/blocking would avoid the damage completely.\nThere is a close range and a high range version of this attack. Key Mechanics T Laser - Meldita moves backwards and then shoots a laser to the front and then to his left, followed by a laser to his right.\nHealer should not stand directly to the side of the boss 360 Laser into Worms - This happens at 95% and is on a 90 second cooldown.\nThe boss will sit down on the ground and give a text message saying “Taste this!”\nAfter a moment he will fire a laser in front of him then he starts rotating clockwise, killing everyone who gets hit. To deal with this as a tank, you move slightly to the right so that you don’t get hit by the first part of the laser.\nAs a dps you are going to have to iframe this as it reaches you.\nDuring this attack, Meldita will start spawning a couple of worms around the map.\nIt is very important that you kill these as quickly as possible because if you do not, the worms will multiply. These worms fire projectiles at Meldita that heal if they reach it. You want to get in between the Worms and Meldita to avoid healing the boss, it does deal some damage though. Floor 5: Kelsaik Special attacks Stun/pushback - This mechanic will only happen at the beginning.\nHe will slightly lower his head, and after a short delay, he will raise his head and roar. That’s when you want to iframe. Usually you just ignore this mechanic though, as you’re just blocking it with blue shield. Tail smash - The indicator is that the boss will do a brief pause, and then it will it will smash it tail super quickly.\nThis attack is both blockable and iframeable. Jump - Occasionally the boss will do a jump, kinda like before he spawn minions. Again make sure you dodge this, as it can be quite punishing in terms of damage.\nIf you’re uncomfortable you can simply walk this mechanic out, by going on a distance of ~15 meters. Ice Storm - The boss will have ice swirling around it, and after a brief delay, an ice storm will appear.\nThis is both iframe and blockable, so if you’re on ice side, you can actually just stay in. If you’re fire, jump and stay safe. Fire Storm - The boss will have fire swirling around it, and then it will do a fire storm, where fire will appear everywhere, and meteors will come raining from the sky.,\nIt’s kinda the same as the stun, you want to iframe just before he lifts his head, as to avoid getting hit by the fire storm. If you get hit by the fire or ice storm, you will take the debuff from the corresponding mechanic, so if you get hit by ice, you get ice debuff and vice versa. Key Mechanics Inner Temperature - This boss generally isn’t very hard in terms of attacks. What makes this boss hard is managing your heat bar.\nThe heat bar is displayed in your upper right corner per default, and it indicates what your current heat is. The trick here is to manage the heat, and not get too much heat or too little heat, in other words you want to stay as close as possible to 50 at all times, so you avoid going too close to either 100 or 0. When no debuffs have been taken: If you have overload of ice: If you have overload of fire: Taking the debuff\rYou get these debuffs by getting hit by specific attacks from the boss, in particular the most important one is when the boss lifts both front paws and smash the ground!\nFurthermore, you can take the debuffs by going in front of the boss and then take the debuffs by going to the specific paw, that holds the debuff\rHow to manage the debuff\rAs mentioned, you want to stay as close to 50 as possible, and the trick is to “switch sides”.\nThe bar will go up or down quicker, depending on the overload of one debuff This means, that if you for example have the following:\n3 ice and 2 fire The bar will decrease with 1 per second On the other hand, if you have the following:\n3 fire and 2 ice The bar will increase with 1 per second But, if you’ve messed up and have for example:\n4 fire and 1 ice The bar will increase with 3 per second And if you’ve messed up even more, and for example have:\n0 fire and 5 ice The bar will increase with 5 per second Minions - A text will appear on screen saying :\nℹ️ Kelsaik prepares to summon minions” After that he will do a brief pause and jump into the air and fall down again. You have to iframe this, as this will most likely be a one-shot otherwise. When the boss has done the jump, the boss will spawn two mobs: One fire mob and an ice mob. The important thing here is that the mobs can only be killed by players, who have the opposite debuff of the mob.\nEach mob count as an extra fire or ice debuff! - So if you’re for example having an overload of ice debuff, you should wait a bit with killing the fire mob and kill the ice mob ASAP.\nFloor 6: Krakatox This floor is fairly easy and more of a DPS check, rather than a mechanic heavy fight.\nFurthermore, you cannot go through this boss, which is a huge handicap for a lot of classes, instead you will have to manually walk around it. Special attacks Double Swing - The boss will simply do a double swing with his weapon. He pulls out the weapon, then he will swing right, and afterwards he will swing left.\nThe right swing doesn’t hit you in the back, but it’s an indicator for the left swing, which will hit you, if you don’t dodge. Triple smash into front smash - The boss will essentially do three hits with his weapon on the tank, then smash his weapon into the ground, dealing light damage AoE damage, if you don’t dodge or block it.\nSingle smash AoE - The boss will essentially pull out his weapon, then hold his left for a while and then smash the ground, creating a huge AoE, that can be quite punishing.\nThis one should usually be dodged or blocked at anytime, to avoid putting too much stress on the healer, plus it can KD. Range target - Krakatox will target someone at too far range, and throw a head after the target - simply iframe this one, and avoid standing too far away.\nCage - The boss will randomly target a person, again usually the one furthest away, and you have to iframe this, as you otherwise will get caged, and the dps’es will then have to kill that cage, before you’re able to move, cast spells and so on again.\nLittle spike that appear under your character, indicate the cage. Laser - The boss will target someone entirely at random, and a laser will be aimed at the targeted person.\nYou should try and aim the laser away from other people in the party. The laser cannot be blocked, only iframed. The timing is a bit weird, and it’s better to dodge towards the boss, rather than away Different patters for Krakatox - The attacks alternate, meaning that if he for example did a right/left swipe the next one will be right swipe/laser.\nIf he did triple smash into front smash, then the next one will be triple smash without front smash, and that way he will always his attacks in a 1\u0026gt;2\u0026gt;1\u0026gt;2 system. Key Mechanics Crystal shard - The first thing you want to make sure you master is the crystal.\nThe crystal is spawning every the text on the screen says “The Demokron shard has been created”. What you need to do is simply destroy it, since else it will wipe the party by exploding. You will get a debuff that will keep stacking, MAKING YOU LOSE HP but GAIN ATTACK POWER. Prepare potions to ease out healers job. Floor 7: Lakan Essentially this boss doesn’t require a lot of teamwork, but it requires a huge amount of consistency and the ability to dodge shit around the arena.\nSpecial attacks Key Mechanics Floor 8: Desolarus Special attacks Key Mechanics Floor 9: Darkan Special attacks Key Mechanics Floor 10: Shandra Manaya Special attacks Key Mechanics Sources EssentialMana - Lowers Trappiez (beginner) Guide for DS 2018 "},"title":"Dreadspire (Uppers)"},"/dungeon-guide/mt/":{"data":{"":"Dungeons currently open on MT: The Dream private server.\nSelect a dungeon to learn more!\nDungeons in the [Currently on MT: The Dream] get updated for easier access to the most-wanted guides.\nYou can also expand the side-menu to view more dungeons if necessary.\nUnless the dungeons are very different, you can find (Normal) and (Hard) modes explained on one page.\n"},"title":"MT:The Dream Dungeons"},"/dungeon-guide/mt/antaroth-abyss-hard/":{"data":{"":"","first-boss-ghergof#First Boss: Ghergof":"","last-boss-antaroth#Last Boss: Antaroth":"","second-boss-kalioth#Second Boss: Kalioth":"","sources#Sources":"\rFirst Boss: Ghergof Key Mechanics Ice Puddle - The boss will target one of the players with a growing red circle, once it fills it will put down an Ice patch which will be used to avoid the mechanic below.\nIt is important to place this away from the boss, but not far because you’re going to need it for the “Delete This” mechanic. Delete This - A text message will show up saying :\nℹ️ “Your flesh will be deleted!” The boss will first do a map wide AoE that needs to be iframed, failure to iframe this will result a knock up and the boss targeting that person with the following Fire Breath. This will happen before you land so you will die. After the AoE it’ll target two people with a Fire Breath which can be survived by going into the Ice Patch. Massive In-Out - This one is decided by whether or not the boss is enraged.\nThe first part of this mechanic is a map wide AoE that needs to be iframed. 🚫 Enraged: Big AoE, Inner AoE, Outer AoE\nNot enraged: Big AoE, Outer AoE, Inner AoE Double AoE - In this mechanic he will put a circle under every single party member, the DPS and the healer need to stack behind the boss while the tank moves back a little bit.\nIt will then do an AoE with the safe spot being where people are gathered and on the tank. Directly afterwards it will do an AoE on the safe spots, so you have to iframe directly as the red circle disappears. Basic attacks Shish Kebab - Simple 1-hit attack Slash - Simple 1-hit attack. Double Slash - Same like above, but twice 4x Slash - Same like above, but four times Jump - The boss jumps at the tank, often used when the tank is away from the boss.\nJumping Jack - Boss jumps sideways and back multiple times, actual boss hitbox stays in the middle.\nSpecial attacks Shield AoE - An AoE attack that also hits behind the boss.\nGetting hit by this attack will knock you back. Shield Barrage - A barrage of hits on the tank.\nWill push back the tank. Small AoE - A small AoE being put on one of the members, it can be blocked and iframed.\nIn-Out or Out-In - On this boss it is decided by whether or not the boss backsteps or not.\nIf the boss backsteps it will do an outer AoE followed by an inner AoE. If the boss does not backstep it do an inner AoE followed by an outer AoE Can be iframed. Second Boss: Kalioth Key Mechanics Debuffs - A text message will show up on the screen saying :\nℹ️ ”Sacrificial target selected.” The boss will then gain a Blue or Red colored Aura. Followed an AoE attack that requires someone to get hit by it.\nThe idea behind this mechanic is that the party has to rotate getting hit by this, getting hit by this gives you a 3 minute lasting debuff that will kill you if you get hit again.\nIf nobody gets hit the attack the boss will wipe the party, so make sure to have 1 person get hit.\nThis attack will do either an inner or an outer AoE, this is dependent on the color of the Aura he gets. Look at the picture on the right.\n🚫 Aura is Blue = Outer AoE\nPerson taking the debuff should get to the outer circle.\nThe people who need to dodge should get close to the boss. 🚫 Aura is Red = Inner AoE\nPerson taking the debuff should get to the inner circle.\nThe people who need to dodge should get away from the boss. Blue - Outer\rRed - Inner\rAfter 50% boss’ HP he will use one additional debuff AOE, and after 20% HP he will start casting them much more faster: at more than double at the speed as before.\nBasic attacks Left, Right, Swipe, (Second Swipe) - He’ll start with his left weapon, then follow it up with a hit from his right weapon. He will then look over one of his shoulders and swipe on that side.\nBelow 50%: He will do a Second Swipe after the First one. Left Shoulder, above 50%\rLeft Shoulder, below 50%\rRight Shoulder, above 50%\rRight Shoulder, below 50%\rRight, Left, Stab, Wave - The boss will start with a Right hit, followed by Left, then Stab the tank and throw a cone-shaped Wave at the tank.\nGetting hit gives a cleansable debuff. Right, Left, Left, Cross - The boss will start with a Right hit, followed by Left, followed by another Left and then hit the tank with a Cross shaped double attack.\nRight, Right, Back, Shockwave - Boss attacks with his Right Weapon twice, turning around and hitting behind him and then using a Wave attack.\nSpecial attacks Circles into Outer Donut - The boss will put circles on everyone, slightly after they disappear and reappear you need to iframe and get close to the boss because he will follow up by an outer AoE circle.\nThis can be avoided if the healer is quick on cleansing. Stun Blast - The boss will aim both his weapons down and then smash them into the ground to put a big stun AoE around the boss, hitting the tank as well as the DPS directly behind the boss.\nGetting hit by this will stun and the boss will then target you. This can be avoided if the healer is quick on cleansing. Spin - The boss will lower his weapons next to his body and then start spinning, doing his Swordnado attack.\nThis can be blocked and iframed Jump into Wave - The boss will jump at a player, stunning whoever gets hit. Following up with a Wave attack in front of him if someone got stunned.\nThis can be avoided if the healer is quick on cleasing. Player got hit\rPlayer dodged attack\rRandom Wave - The boss will put secondary aggro on one of the DPS or the healer and will then attack them with a Wave.\nThis puts a cleansable debuff on the people who got hit. Last Boss: Antaroth Key Mechanics Mana Burst - After call of\nℹ️ “Dispersing collected mana!” Antaroth will unleash uniframable room wide attack. This attack deal flat damage per stack of Mana Burst on target. It also applies a nasty MP reducing debuff which need to be cleansed fast. ⚠️ Cleanses all stacks of Mana Burst. Red Magic - Boss charges up his sword and then does a series of 4 attacks:\n1) Thrust – blockable and iframable, survivable, applies Mana Burst 2) Spin – not blockable but iframable, survivable, applies Mana Burst and heavy cleansable bleed 3) Half circle blast – uniframable, lethal damage 4) Series of AOEs – uniframable, hit for 100% of targets HP, can survive with shields\nVersion 1: Thrust, clockwise Spin, Half blast on boss’s left, AOEs from in to out Version 2: Thrust, counter clockwise Spin, Half blast on boss’ right, AOEs from out to in AOEs have unintuitive timing – they deal damage at time they appear, and the lingering animation is harmless. Expanding Puddles - Antaroth summons 5 expanding puddles, which deal high damage with their edges.\nIframe towards center of bubbles, or run away. It’s good idea to stand closer to the boss, so no puddle spawns directly on you. Not blockable. No Escape - Antaroth calls out :\nℹ️ “Escape option disabled.” Then he casts AOEs on every party member.\nGetting hit by these aoes applies long stun debuff to player hit and creates a small breakable cage around them.\nThese aoes are folowed by several medium damage room-wide attaks, which aren’t iframable ! Tanks can block these attacks and provide 70% damage reduction to nearby party members.\nLight and Dark - With call out :\nℹ️ “Enter your final words now.” Boss will teleport to middle of room and start casting room wide wipe attack. 5 orbs get summoned on edges of room, 3 Light and 2 Dark and each player will get a debuff: 2 Light and 3 Dark. Players are able to deal damage to opposite color than they have debuff on. Breaking an orb grants a invicibility buff to one nearby player, use this to survive attack he’s casting. Destroy the orb anywhen runes start to appear on the spell circle.\n🚫 The black orb will have a white outlining\nThe white orb will have a black outlining Attack of the clones - After calling out :\nℹ️ “Patience not found.” Players will get applied slow debuff on them, then boss will teleport in middle of the room, and summon 2 clones.\nRight after that all 3 will teleport in sequence to outer circle on the floor, and will either use small Spin, or Blue Ball just throw version at random targets. These attacks apply Mana Burst. 🚫 Teleports away from enterance = He will throw Blue Ball\nTeleports to the door = He will Spin Cage with Shield - After calling out:\nℹ️ “Prepare to be deleted.” He will cast cage soon after and get a shield. Each player will get one of 3 debuffs: Red, Blue, Yellow.\nPlayers must look at their debuff and take slice of same color to refresh their debuff – else they will die after it expires.\nBoss will also get shield up during this cage, you need to deal enough damage to him down to break it, else he will cast 4th slices and wipe the party.\n* This attack is only used below 40% of boss’ HP.\rBasic attacks Two upward slashes - Simple two slashed upwards.\nOne upward slash - Simple slash upwards.\nTwo downward slashes - Simple two slashes downwards.\nOverhand strike - Simple slash from above.\nSpecial attacks Jump - Secondary aggro jump, stuns, unleashes punishing spin if target was not cleansed.\nGetting hit by either of these attacks stacks Mana Burst Front hammer into Back hammer - Boss eyes flash red for a second. It’s unblockable, iframable and getting hit stuns.\nIf someone was hit not cleansed of the stun, he unleashes punishing spin. Getting hit by either of these attacks stacks Mana Burst Two up, Two up, Back slam - Same as hammers above, just that it only hits one to the back.\nGetting hit by either of these attacks stacks Mana Burst Blue ball throw - Boss winds up with a blue ball, and either hits tank with it, launches a beam, or both.\nAntharos only starts using hit + beam and beam only on lower HPs. Watch for the ground when beam is comming. Getting hit by either of these attacks stacks Mana Burst Teleport back - He teleports back and uses either Front hammer into Back hammer, or Spin\nSources Essential Mana "},"title":"Antaroth Abyss (Hard)"},"/dungeon-guide/mt/dark-reach-citadel-hard/":{"data":{"":"","bookshelf#Bookshelf":"","first-boss-theropath#First Boss: Theropath":"","last-boss-harnovog#Last Boss: Harnovog":"","second-boss-apetus#Second Boss: Apetus":"","sources#Sources":"\rFirst Boss: Theropath Key Mechanics Pull AoE - The boss will pull everyone towards him and then put an iframeable AoE on everyone, to survive this people need to spread so that the AoE does not overlap.\nThey do 50% HP damage in Normal Mode and 75% in Hard Mode. If you hit the boss with an AoE in hard mode the gauge will add 30 to it. Gauge fills - The gauge will appear when the boss reaches 90% HP, with 5 pillars activating across the room, much like in RK9 Extreme Mode.\nThis gauge will then slowly charge up to 100 stacks and when it reaches a 100 the pillars will spawn an orb before them. Every member of the party needs to collect (touch, don’t need to hit) an orb to survive the incoming room wide people attack. Normal Mechanic\rHard Mode under 50% HP\rNote: The pillars fire AoEs of electricity when a player is nearby, These AoEs will either stun you, or pushback and put bleed on you. Make sure to dodge the AoE that will most likely get fired when you go collect the orb.\nHard Mode: If the boss is below 50% then this boss will then target one player with fairly wide laser attack that requires people to gather and split the damage to for tank to survive it.

Whole attack is unblockable. Second Boss: Apetus Pokemon in TERA, this boss can change itself to either Grass, Fire, or Water he will do so by walking towards the corresponding books.\nIf you have super effective, you will tiny bit do more damage to boss.\nTo gain the opposing buff you just have to gather around the book and then someone has to hit it to give everyone in the area the buff. Not having this boss will make it hard to survive during the specific elemental mechanics.\nKey Mechanics No Type - The boss targets a player and fires a laser that needs to be dodged.\n(read: not iframed but avoided – use movement skills). Pulls in the target if hit and then puts a small unavoidable AoE under them which removes elemental buff from everyone hit. Try to refresh it as soon as possible to avoid bleeding.

Then the Demon Player will get targeted by lasers which must be iframed, lasers hitting you means you die and explode.\nTremble Before Me! - A text message will indicate that this mechanic is coming.\n“Tremble before me!” First he will do an AoE Stun followed by a large AoE that gives the boss stacks depending on how long people stand in it.\nThis will stack up very fast and has 3 levels of power: (Too little, Weak and Strong).\nToo little - he gets stunned Weak - it does some damage that can\u0026rsquo;t be avoided Strong - he will most likely wipe the party (you can ress quickly without boss resetting) Basic attacks Frontal Attack / Left - Simple 1-hit attack\nFrontal Attack / Right - Simple 1-hit attack\nDouble Downwards - Simple 2-hit attack\nDouble Upwards - Simple 2-hit attack\nRight Into Swipe - 1-hit attack followed by a swipe unblockable towards the front.\nDouble Upwards Into Back-Swipe - 2-hit attack followed by a swipe towards the back.\nSpecial attacks Double Into Stun - Simple 2-hit attack followed by a stun.

Out, or in?’ Above 50% HP: The boss will have a message saying “Odd? or Even?” before this mechanic occurs. At this instant, you must watch for the color of the aura surrounding him. Under 50% HP: The boss will not have a message shown. Instead, you will see the color of the aura surrounding him while he puts AoE under players. When you start to see him glow Red or Blue, you must remember if your total sum of the previous mechanic was Odd or Even.\nIf the Boss glows Blue, Even = Donut AoE ;; Odd = Circle AoE\nIf the Boss glows Red, Odd = Donut AoE ;; Even = Circle AoE\nOdds are Red\rEvens are Blue\rOpposites have Fled\rAlikes are Glued\rBasic attacks Whack - Simple hit on the front aggro holder. Blockable and iframable.\nDouble Whack - Same thing as above. Blockable, iframable.\nWham - Raises his weapon and slams on the tank.\nSometimes this may bleed through block. iframe when needed. Crawl - Boss moves during this attack. If failed to block properly, he will crawl over you.\nBreath - If there’s someone too far away from the boss, he may randomly target a person with this attack.\nSpray - Even if you are not exactly inside the AoE, you might still get hit by this attack.\nRear Breath - Same as front breath, just from rear.\nHurts a lot + Knockdown. Special attacks Slam - Inflicts Stun. If there is a stunned target, he will whip the surrounding with his body.\nBlockable and Iframable. Whip - He will do this if there was anyone stunned from the body slam attack. This attack also inflicts bleed.\nNot blockable. Final Boss: Demoros This guy is a bit special: at the beginning of battle, you will see the following gauge.\nThe Red gauge represents Demoros’ Dice, while Blue represents Player’s Dice. This gauge fills up based on Demoros’ Key mechanics. Key Mechanics Roulette’s Color - Watch the sphere around the map to see which direction it circles around (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\nIt spawns when this message is announced: ℹ️ Rolling…” It stops moving when Demoros announces:\nℹ️ This time, it’s Red/Blue/White”. The first sphere always moves clockwise.\nDepending on which direction it spins around the map, the “Colored Dice” mechanic will be dealt differently. Memorize Color and Direction. Colored Dice - To clear this mechanic, you must remember the previously mentioned Color and Direction.\nWith the red notice “Demoros is summoning dice!”, three dice with different colors will appear around the map. Demoros will also initiate a pull, so time your iframe to avoid it. If the sphere’s direction was Clockwise, you must break the Colors of dice that were NOT mentioned. If the sphere’s direction was Counter-clockwise, you must break only the Color of die that was mentioned before. Usually, when this mechanic is successfully done, the players roll the dice higher than Demoros here, he will be stunned briefly.\nIf the players roll higher than Demoros, the next sphere spawn will be clockwise. If the Demoros rolls higher than the players, the next sphere spawn will be counter-clockwise. Multi-Dice Roll - A message will be announced:\n⚠️ You still think you can win?” Demoros will move to the center and summon four dice around him. Then, the map will begin to draw a pattern toward the center.\nIf this pattern is filled, then Demoros will initiate wipe mechanic shortly after. To prevent wiping, players must break the dice to create a safe zone. It is best advised to break the dice with highest value on them. The sum of any remaining dice on the map will be added to Demoros’ Gauge. FEVER TIME! Demoros is recovering in the Otherworld.\nWhen Demoros’ HP falls below 30%, he will disappear from the map and regenerate his HP back to 69%. Meanwhile, coins will fall from the sky. Blue AoE coins do not inflict damage and grant 1 points each. Red AoE coins inflict 70k damage but grant 3 points each. Spread apart to gain as many points as possible. Demoros Returns – “You’re doomed!” - When Demoros returns, he will initiate Circle and Donut attack. You must watch out for the color and remember the original color he had at the beginning of the battle.\nSame color, it will be Donut → Circle.\rDifferent color, it will be Circle → Donut.\rRoulette mechanic will no longer appear, but he will recover 0.33% HP every second.\nWhen his HP reaches 100%, he will initiate a 90 second timer. After the timer ends, he will wipe the party. Occasionally Red AoE coins will also drop. Your party should take turns to take the coin to gain as many points as possible. Only one player can take the coin at a time.\nWhen he initiates colored dice mechanic, attack all three dice to roll them all. Remember, your ultimate goal is to reach 100 points before Demoros does to clear the dungeon.\nBasic attacks Dice Clap - Hits twice on front. If youre close you will only be hit by the first hit.\nBlockable and iframable Double Clap - Hits once front, then once back.\nBlockable and iframable. Breath - Shudders and breathes on the tank, this is blockable and iframable.\nDice Scramble - Hits front 3 times with dices.\nDice Throw - Hits front 3 times with dices.

This is blockable and iframable.\nLaser - Demoros shakes a little and creates a laser out of his chest. Not blockable.\nRecommended to immediately iframe out of this attack as it deals flat damage per tick. Special attacks Puddles - Watch for Demoros’ surrounding color.\nIf it’s Blue, it creates AoE bomb once.\rIf it’s Red, it creates AoE bomb twice in the same place.\rYou can also tell by looking at the AoE after effect as well. Circle and Donut - Demoros will always initiate combat with this attack with the order: Donut → Circle.\nYou must watch for the color at the first engagement as this mechanic will be based on which color he starts with. If he initiates this attack again later in the fight, you must check if it was the same color. Same color, it will be Donut → Circle.\rDifferent color, it will be Circle → Donut.\rPull - With message :\nℹ️ Come Here! Demoros will pull in players then attack its surroundings with an AoE. Either iframe the pull or iframe out of the AoE.\nSources Essential Mana "},"title":"Demon's Wheel"},"/dungeon-guide/mt/grotto-of-lost-souls-hard/":{"data":{"":"","first-boss-nedra#First Boss: Nedra":"","last-boss-kylos#Last Boss: Kylos":"","second-boss-ptakum#Second Boss: Ptakum":"","sources#Sources":"\rFirst Boss: Nedra The room and yourself will be surrounded in either Purple or Green auras. Periodically flowers will drop down from the sky; we’ll talk more about this in Key Mechanics. Understand that getting hit by the flower explosion will swap your debuff. After all flowers are done dropping, you need to have an aura that matches with the color of the room. Key Mechanics Flowers - A text message saying :\nℹ️ A Strange Odor Fills the Air Will show up and the outer area of the map will start glowing Purple or Green. The entire party will also get a debuff which gives you a Purple or Green aura as well. The room and yourself will have these auras until the : ℹ️ Aren’t You Pretty?” Text message appears, which indicates that the boss will go underground and flowers start falling to the ground.\nDuring this mechanic, you **must make your aura match the color of the room. These flowers explode as they hit the ground and can be iframed but you don’t always want to iframe them. Getting hit by an explosion will switch the debuff you have;\nGreen will become Purple and vice-versa. To dodge an explosion, you must iframe. Either 1 or 2 flowers will fall.\nTwo flowers\nOne Golden flower - Under 40% HP of the boss, only one golden flower will spawn which has to be destroyed to change debuffs.\nBasic attacks Swipe - Simple 1-hit attack. Bite - Simple 2-hit attack.\nCharge - Charge Attack, hits 5 times.\nFart - Attack tank with hands, pause a bit, then fart behind which causes pushback.\nBig Bite - Double hit in the front, shares animation with Fart – difference being in mouth starting to glow.\nBlockable, but second hit hurts through block, preferably iframe it. Plant Boom - 3 Blockable attacks in front of the boss, followed by an iframable flower explosion on everyone.\nSpecial attacks Who wants to feed me? - The boss will go underground with the message\nWho wants to feed me?\rAnd does an AoE attack near the one with secondary aggro. This AoE stuns, and if anyone gets stunned, the boss eats him, killing him. Get away from the initial position of secondary aggro or iframe.\nThorn Hell - Boss does an AoE and then goes underground, releasing thorn balls in a specific circular pattern.\nGetting hit by the AoE will put a cleansable \u0026amp; slowing debuff on you. Thorns cause bleed on hit. Walk around or iframe through them. Thorn Wall - The boss quickly does two series of 2 bites then follows with an attack that spawns Thorn Walls on target(s) far away. Spawns one in Normal Mode and two in Hard Mode.\nA small purple ring will appear under your feet if you are about to be targeted. These walls last around 1 to 2 seconds. End of animation is identical to Plant Boom. Standing in it does no damage, but moving or iframing into the walls will stun you. Impaler - The claws of the boss start glowing and he will throw an iframeableAoE attack at the secondary aggro target. Will knock up if you get hit. Ress bait in Hard Mode.\nRock ‘n Roll - Rocks fall from the sky and roll from the front of the boss to behind the boss, then the boss rolls backwards. Can be iframed or facetanked.\nThe dirt animation will alert you to whether large or small rocks will fall. Large rocks have a larger amount \u0026amp; area of dirt falling. Hard to see in the videos. Big rocks\rSmall rocks\rSecond Boss: Ptakum In this room there are 3 statues. They’re purpose will be explained in Key Mechanics, however do take note that every statue slowly releases an expanding AoE that puts a debuff on the first target it hits. This includes the boss. Key Mechanics Statue lasers - The statues are the most important part of this boss fight. There are 3 statues in this room – their names are Bloody (Red), Radiant (White), and Cursed (Purple).\nEach one of them produces a wave that puts their debuff on the first target it hits. The goal is to get all 3 of the debuffs on the boss. To do this, don’t get hit by the statue’s wave. You cannot iframe through this wave, you must run from it. Depending on how many debuffs are on boss / players, he will do different attacks during this mechanic: All 3 on boss: the boss will be stunned for a short duration. 0-1 on players: 30% HP damage to everyone and applying 1 bleed stack + powerup buff on boss 2 on players: 50% HP damage to everyone and applying 2 bleed stacks + powerup buff on boss 3 on players: 100% HP damage to everyone. This ignores shield so it’s just a wipe. Statues can be destroyed with the Break Wave attack.This also degrades the mechanic to a lower tier and a wipe can be avoided.\nIn Hard Mode he will do 2 statues at same time below 50% like so: In/Out - After the In or Out attack he will do either a large AoE around him or a small AoE on all players.\nThese need to be iframed. Boss will be visibly winding up for a spin in the Outer AoE clip, while he does not wind up for the Inner AoE.\nGetting hit by the second attack of the inner AoE will pushback. Getting hit by the second attack of the Outer AoE will throw you in the air and toss you. Basic attacks Right Left - A simple Right, Left hit. Left Right - A simple Left, Right hit. Left Turn - Boss turns to hit the back. Right Turn - Boss turns to hit the back.\nApplies bleed Target swipe - Boss turns towards secondary aggro and swipes at them. Special attacks Double Right, Big front - Hits the tank twice with blockable attacks. Followed by a massive front hit. Getting hit by the massive will stun you. Break wave - The boss will charge up a laser at a secondary target and then fire it.\nNotified by message ℹ️ I will break you!” This laser can be used to break one of the statues. You will only be targeted if you have one of the statue debuffs. Back into Roll and wave -\nWaves - The boss will do a wave attack in front of him followed by a wave attack behind him (unblockable).\nThis is the attack that happens when stunned by Double Right, big front. Bad breath donuts - The boss will do 3 outer donuts AoE followed by frontal Breath.\nThis attack can be blocked, but can bleed trough block a bit in lesser gears. Secondary Target Lasers - The boss shoots a barrage of lasers at a secondary target.\nLast Boss: Kylos The Awakening phases in Hard Mode are Awakening 1 at 80% and Awakening 2 at 30%.\nThe boss will do room wide silencing and pushback attack whenever a phase starts. Awakening 2 is visibly slower than awakening 1, shown below. Key Mechanics Stacks on boss - It’s recommended to count the stacks the boss has, but there are also visual cues:\nIf boss has at least 1 stack he will have purple buff in his buff bar, and his whole body will glow according to number of stacks he has. When the attack is fully charged, there will be a red glow on his wings. 1 Stack: Fully charged:\nChain Lightning Monuments - This mechanic will begin at at 75% and have a different variation below 40%.\nDebris will fall from the sky onto each party member. Getting hit stuns so you must move or iframe once the location locks. During this mechanic, a monument will spawn a far distance from the boss. In Hard Mode, two will spawn under 40%, where one is directly next to the boss. To do this correctly, you must use Chain lightning to break the monument.\nTo do this, party members must line up (3 members for the far monument, one for the closer) so that the lightning the boss creates travels through the party members to the monument. If this mechanic is done incorrectly, party HP will be set to 1 for several seconds. You cannot be healed with this debuff active.\nDeath will remove the debuff. It is notable that parties usually do not break the far away monument unless the healer prefers it, or it is a learning run. In Hard Mode, failing both monuments is a wipe. 4 Stack Lightning - Once the boss has done 4 Empowered attacks during Awakening 1 or 2 Empowered attacks during Awakening 2, he will do lightning attack that needs to be iframed.\nThe distinct animation and message (Lightning!) is extremely quick so a fast reaction is needed. Fly into Spin (left/right) - Occasionally the boss will fly up into the air with a secondary aggro target.\nAfter the boss lands facing the target, he will spin on one side, casting an unblockable expanding AoE wave. Depending on the direction of his turn, he will follow with an uniframeable \u0026amp; unblockable half-circle AoE. It happens on the side he spinned to. The expanding wave goes faster during enrage. Left:\nRight:\nHe will also spawn 0 (Normal), 1 (Awakening 1), or 3 (Awakening 2) orbs on the side of the half-circle. These need to be destroyed. Successfully breaking the orbs: Basic attacks Swipe- Simple 1-hit attack with left arm. Double tap - Simple 2-hit attack with right arm.\nBreath combo - Simple 4-hit attack. Breath pushbacks.\nBackblast - Simple attack on dps. Blockable and iframeable.\nCauses Chain lightning. This is an Empowered attack. Tritail - Second attack on dps, this one a bit more dangerous, care when dealing with this.\nCauses Chain lightning. This is an Empowered attack. Secondary aggro/Ress bait - There are two different secondary aggro attacks, care about them. Both are unblockable but iframable.\nCauses pushback if hit. Special attacks Basic hit + Wing slam + Back wing slam - Second hit is unblockable \u0026amp; uniframeable, and third hit is unblockable.\nCauses Chain lightning on 2nd \u0026amp; 3rd hit. This is an Empowered attack. The boss can also fly up at the end and do unblockable \u0026amp; uniframeable expanding donut attack. The swipe happens in the direction the boss looks towards. Lightning Combo - Tanks should be careful for this mechanic as the movements can be difficult to get used to.\nThe first two hits are blockable, but the 3rd and 4th hit are unblockable \u0026amp; uniframeable one shots that cause Chain lightning. The breath is blockable but hard hitting. It is recommended to iframe. This is an Empowered attack. 3 Frontal Wingslams - The boss will slam tank with 3 blockable wing attacks, then might follow up with AoE on damage dealers and an unblockable frontal AoE.\nCauses Chain lightning on 2nd \u0026amp; 3rd hit. This is an Empowered attack only if the long version is performed.

Earthquake - If Polyphemus is not stunned by a bomb after Leaping, he will unleash two waves of damage (iframeable) across the entire arena, dealing flat damage.\nPolyphemus does not announce who he is targeting (although there is still the secondary aggro purple circle). The waves will deal high damage, which has a much higher probability of killing players who failed to dodge. Petrification - Polyphemus will target a random player and fire a large conal attack that deals heavy damage and leave a debuff that will petrify a player after a few seconds if not cleansed.\nBomb Sparks - Players are warned by :\nℹ️ “Look Out!” After a few seconds a number of players will receive a large orange circle. After a few seconds, they will be knocked up for a long period of time. Last Boss: Kalivan Key Mechanics Flooding - Throughout the fight, quarters of the arena will be flooded in water. The water doesn’t deal damage by itself, though if you are electrified with Electricity Overload, you will take damage.\nWater lanes will flood more often as the fight goes on. Electricity Overload Certain attacks will apply Electricity Overload on players for 45 seconds. If players step into Flooded areas while they have Electricity Overload, any player in the area takes damage. Electricity Overload will stack up to five times.

Big Lightning Bolt - Message of :\nℹ️ “(Player) is targeted by Big Lightning Bolt” Is announced and a random player is targeted for an attack. The player will be stunned and will be struck with heavy damage in 6 seconds. Party members should stay inside the target circle in order to split the damage taken. If taken solo, will deals very high damage to a single player. Mystic thralls, Gunner ST-4 and Warrior shadows count as extra bodies to help split the damage.

In the middle of the map there’s 4 big circles and 4 smaller circles.\nA text indicator will show up saying : ℹ️ Kalavese is spraying flammable liquid” Followed by 1 or 2 people, excluding the one having aggro, will get a debuff which needs to be removed within 45 seconds. Failure to do so will result in an explosion dealing damage to the entire party and giving them a uncleansable bleed. This deals 100% of hp to the person exploding and 50% to everyone else. While you can survive this with a great healer, it’s not recommended at all. To remove this debuff you need to get hit by 1 of the 4 Fire Pits.\nThis big circle slowly fills until it erupts and clearing the people inside of it of the debuff. The smaller circles don’t have any real purpose except for making it more visible to see which Fire Pit will erupt. Basic attacks Frontal Attack - Usual simple pinch smash.\nFrontal 7 smash - This attack pushes back the tank, as mentioned before.. It’s ideal to tank the boss in the middle.\nHard Mode and Enrage: He starts with 2 hits attack before doing the 7 atacks. Special attacks Turn and Back attack - Boss turns around to attack the players behind him.\nWhen the boss turns he’ll attack one additional time by turning and then puking on the DPS, this is not iframable but needs to be moved out range from. If someone gets hit by this attack he will then fart on the Tank before turning back which needs to be iFramed. Jump - Boss jumps in the air and comes dropping down, hitting all around the boss.\nWhen the boss comes down and he’s Enraged, he’ll do a spin which needs to be moved out of or else he’ll target that person with a one shot jump. Second Boss: Thormemtum Key Mechanics Catapults - During this boss fight there’s 4 catapults, in normal mode all 4 of them will use the same ammunition, in hard mode it’s a bit different.\nAt 90% the first catapult will start firing, then at every 20% hp increment another one will start firing. (So at 90%, 70%, 50% and lastly at 30%)\nAt 70% the East Catapult will start firing, this one fires suicide bombing Caimens. When it first hits the ground it will just remain there, when a player gets close it will then start following that person and then explode when it comes close.\nA healer should go get the aggro from these Caimen and pull them away from the DPS and Tank, you can iframe away from the aoe before it explodes. At 50% the South Catapult will start firing, this one fires poison puddles which slowly grows bigger before exploding inflicting damage, a silence and a slow.\nAt 30% the West Catapult will start firing bombs that will fire a laser horizontally and vertically at the same time, dealing 70% people’s max hp if you get hit.\nBasic attacks Frontal Smash - Pulls his arm back to slam the tank.\nFrontal Slam - Lifts his disc in the air and slams it down on the tank.\nDouble Frontal Spam - Lifts his arm into the air and thn slams with his disc\nSlam and Spin - Slams his fist on the tank and then rotates to slam his disc down\nDisc spin - His heart lights up and then he spins his disc around himself dealing damage to the entire party\nCan be blocked Spin slam behind - He spins and then rotates to slam down someone behind the boss. Usually targets the player furthest away from the boss\nHealer: You can go behind the tank to avoid the boss turning too much. Special attacks Frontal slam v2 - The boss’ heart lights up and he’ll then slam the tank, this needs to be iframed.\nFailure to do so will make the tank do his spin attack, almost certainly killing the tank. If you Iframed:\nIf you got hit:\nGun Fire front or back - Thormemtum’s rocket in his chest will light up in red and he’ll fire at the tank. If you get hit by this the catapults will start targeting you.\nCan not be iframed, move to the side of the boss. If it lights up as red it will fire at the tank, if it stays in this animation for a second it’ll turn and fire behind him. Disassemble and Spin - A text indication will show up on your screen saying :\nℹ️ “Thormemtum summons vortex.” This time you need to get away from the boss because if you get hit the boss will spawn Tornados which will launch you up in the air. Triple Hit Pull - The boss will slam his hand on the ground three times in quick succession, getting hit by the 3rd attack will pull you to the front of the boss followed by an attack doing 60% HP damage.\nIframe just before you see the third ground slam. Getting hit by this will give you the debuff that make the Catapults target you. Last Boss: Argog A lot of the attacks in this boss fight will involve Argog teleporting onto players and doing an AOE attack on them, so it’s very important that players spread out when the boss does these types of attacks.\n⚠️ This boss fight exists of 2 phases in Normal mode and 3 in Hard mode. In Hard Mode the second phase will start at 80% and the third phase at 30%. Second and third phase will be called “True Form” in this guide. Key Mechanics Argog reveals his true himself - Indicated by a text message saying\nℹ️ “Argog reveals himself.” This is a lot like the Stun mechanic mentioned in Special Attack, however here he crouches longer and you can use his fangs as an indication on when to iframe. Lancers: A lancer can use his Guardian Barrier to block the aoe, resulting in nobody having to iframe. Argog is on the hunt - A text message will appear saying\nℹ️ “Argog is on the Hunt” He will then dissappear and teleport to each player individually. Make sure to spread out.\nIframe when you see smoke appear under your character, this indicates he wil target you for the next attack. Argog is tracking scent of a \u0026rsquo;s blood. - A text message will appear saying\nℹ️ “Argog is tracking scent of a player’s blood.” He will then dissappear and teleport to 2 individually doing an AoE attack followed by an attack on the tank Can NOT be blocked. Make sure to spread out.\nIf your screen gets a purple edges that means he will target you next, make sure you’re away from people and iframe. Argog is in a murderous fury - This is the the final phase of the boss, below 30%.\nFirst he will trigger “Argog is on the Hunt”, found above. Now after every set of basic attacks he can teleport onto any of the DPS or Healer and do an AoE attack dealing 80% HP as damage to anyone hit. This attack can be iframed. After the teleport attack he’ll target the tank with a Cross Attack. This attack can be blocked. Basic attacks Left, Right, Cross - He’ll start by hitting with his left hand, followed by his right hand then both hands together in a cross shape.\nIn True Form the Cross attack will inflict a debuff.

Using Infuriate at the start of the fight is a good idea where it won\u0026rsquo;t bleed through block.\nKey Mechanics Pillars - Message shown on the center of your screen.\nℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Pahoegar is gathering power. This mechanic will begin when the boss reaches 94% HP and then repeats about every 50-60 seconds (Normal Mode) from now on. In Hard Mode it repeats around every 40-50 seconds.\nIn Normal Mode, up to 3 players will have a dark orb floating above their heads where a pillar will be placed on the ground from where you stand after a few seconds. In hard mode, this targets up to 4 players. You won\u0026rsquo;t be targeted by this mechanic if you have the highest aggro and if you are a healer in normal mode. In Hard Mode everyone is targeted by this except for the highest aggro player.\nIn hard mode, these pillars will target someone and shoot lasers that will cause major damage. Try to position them diagonally behind the boss the best as you can because as the pillars remain there it will cause multiple AoEs and other effects dealing damage to your party that can be a nuisance. The only way to destroy the pillar are with lasers from the boss. Make sure you place them close together as possible so you can take them all out with just one laser. If you missed one you\u0026rsquo;ll get more chances.\nShield - As long as one pillar remains active, the boss can trigger a shield. He will run to the pillar and kneel down for 10 seconds.\nSuccessfully breaking the shield will stop him from one-shotting the group and one pillar will be destroyed in the process. If failed to break the shield within 10 seconds, the entire party will wipe. In hard mode, even if you try to res after a wipe he\u0026rsquo;ll keep repeating this wipe until everyone dies regardless. The wipe even bypasses damage immunity from Goddess Blessing as well.\nBasic attacks Laser - Boss will tell a message on the center of your screen:¨\nℹ️ \u0026ldquo;(Name), can you dodge this? Look at his tiny hand to see the exact timing to i-frame the laser. Getting hit by this will result taking exactly 100,000 direct damage in normal mode. In Hard Mode you\u0026rsquo;ll take exactly 300,000 direct damage.\nHand Slam + Swing - There are two types of this attack.\nIn Normal Mode, it\u0026rsquo;s the only attack that shows a telegraph indicators underneath him so you should know which hand slam he\u0026rsquo;s doing. If there\u0026rsquo;s a circle around him then he\u0026rsquo;ll swing around him. In Hard Mode, you have to trust your instincts after he slams his hand down whether he\u0026rsquo;ll swing around or not. Just have to play by feel on this one. Rush Attack - He\u0026rsquo;ll plop his arm off, points at the tank, and charges in swinging his drumstick arm around like a maniac.\nIn Normal Mode, if you block before the attack is done you can stop him from moving. In Hard Mode, this attack will push as you block so you can\u0026rsquo;t stop him from moving and you\u0026rsquo;ll be pushed back. Special attacks Drop, Pound, Stomp, and Pound Again - As name suggests, this attack has multiple moves.\n1st attack will drop his arm on the ground attacking in front. 2nd attack will pound his other arm on the ground attacking the front again. 3rd attack will stomp his foot on the ground hitting around the boss so it will hit your DPS party who are behind the boss. 4th attack will pick up his dropped arm and attacking in front. Websplosion - Message shown on the center of your screeen:\nℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Must\u0026hellip; rest\u0026hellip; He\u0026rsquo;ll kneel down and summon AoE circles individually in a pattern.\nSecond Boss: Dakuryon Before the tank approaches the boss, have any healer use a resurrection skill and cancel the animation so the healer will be targeted first giving your group enough time to get in before the boss attacks the tank.\nKey Mechanics None. Just dodge pizzas and burn him down.\nBasic attacks Uppercut - The boss kneels down for a brief moment and then makes a swift uppercut that hits in a straight line that cannot be blocked.\nIn Normal Mode if you see a straight line telegraph on the ground then you\u0026rsquo;ll know that it\u0026rsquo;s this attack. Swing Back - Dakuryon\u0026rsquo;s bracelet starts rotating around his wrist indicating that he\u0026rsquo;ll swing backwards and hit anyone behind him.\nGetting hit by this only take minor damage so if you have a trustful healer you could keep DPSing. Circle AoE - Once his weapon is placed down and then raises his arm up, he\u0026rsquo;ll summon an AoE circle around him that does major damage.\nSpecial attacks Blue Pizza Slice - Message shown on the center of your screen.\nℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Dakuryon is tapping the Bloodshards! In Normal Mode this mechanic happens every 95%, 75%, 55%, and 35%. In Hard Mode this mechanic happens every 90%, 70%, 50%, 30%. Run to the first blue pizza slice to avoid taking heavy damage, after that a small circle will show up around the boss, then run towards the second blue pizza slice that will always be placed somewhere on the opposite side from where the first blue pizza was located.\nYou cannot i-frame this attack as soon as the ground explodes, but you can use skills that absorbs damage like Warp Barrier, Recall, and Smoke Screen.\nIn Hard Mode, the blue color pizza slice at 50% and 30% will not be displayed on the ground so you need to pay closer attention to the slice area that doesn\u0026rsquo;t flash red and that will be your safe zone to stand on. Watch the ripple effect where the 3rd ripple that passes signals that it\u0026rsquo;ll explode so you\u0026rsquo;ll know how much time you have to get out.\nMobs - More mobs will spawn for the next phases.\nIn Hard Mode this mechanic happens every 95%, 75%, 55%, and 35%. More mobs will spawn for the next phases. The boss will target a random person up to three times with a small laser. You can also lure the laser into the mobs that will kill them. The laser can be blocked. While the boss is shooting small lasers he\u0026rsquo;ll have a temporary barrier to take less damage. Light Bulb - Balls will spawn in the room and will rotate around the room that cannot be destroyed so just avoid them.\nLava Floor (Hard Mode Only) - This mechanic happens every 80%, 60%, and 40%.\nRed floors will spawn up to fives times in a row and it will one-shot you. You cannot i-frame this attack as soon as the ground explodes, but you can use skills that absorbs damage like Warp Barrier, Recall, and Smoke Bomb. Burn Phase - Message shown on the center of your screen:\nℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Dakuryon is absorbing power from the Bloodshard! When the boss reaches 20% he\u0026rsquo;ll automatically enter this phase where you have 20 seconds to burn him down to 10% HP to end the fight.\nLast Boss: Imperator (Dakuryon) Before the tank approaches the boss, have any healer use a resurrection skill and cancel the animation so the healer will be targeted first giving your group enough time to get in before the boss attacks the tank.\nKey Mechanics Cage #1 - Begins when boss goes below 85% HP and repeats this periodically.\nMessage shown on the center of your screen. ℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Dakuryon summons soldiers. Mobs have spawn around the room that needs to be killed. Mobs doesn\u0026rsquo;t have much HP so even healers can help out and they are also susceptible to some Crowd Control skills like stun, sleep, etc.\nFew seconds later he will form a cage around him so you need to get inside before it closes or else you\u0026rsquo;ll die.\nLeftover mobs that wasn\u0026rsquo;t killed on time will transform into a different creature where they periodically spit fireballs around the room that you need to avoid. Inside the cage will form donuts and pizza slices on the ground that you have to move out or i-frame that deals lots of damage. Kaia\u0026rsquo;s Shield could probably protect you from one shotting you.\nThe amount of mobs will grow in numbers during each phases as you progress further.\nCage #2 - Begins when boss goes below 75% HP and repeats this periodically.\nMessage shown on the center of your screen. ℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Dakuryon is using the Bloodshard\u0026rsquo;s power! The boss will slowly slam the hilt of his weapon the ground twice knocking players back.\nFew seconds later he will form a cage around him so you need to get inside before it closes or else you\u0026rsquo;ll die.\nInside the cage will form donuts and pizza slices on the ground that you have to move out or i-frame that deals lots of damage. Kaia\u0026rsquo;s Shield could probably protect you from one shotting you.\nCage Debuff (Hard Mode) - Only happens in hard mode and triggers once the boss reaches below 40%.\nWhenever he does Cage #1 or #2 you may be given a debuff with a random number before the pizza and donut mechanic appears inside the cage. You need to purposely get hit by the donut/pizza to remove the debuff. For example if you have the debuff with 3 stacks then you need to deliberately get hit three times to remove this. The debuff gives you higher endurance as long as you have it so that means getting hit by the balls will take minor damage to you as well.\nIf you do not remove the debuff entirely before duration runs out, you\u0026rsquo;ll die.\nTargetting (Hard Mode) - Only happens in Hard Mode.\nMessage shown on the center of your screen. ℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Dakuryon is retargeting. He\u0026rsquo;ll pound his weapon down twice. The first attack will suck you towards him if you get hit.\nAfter the two ground pound attack, whoever is closest to the boss will get debuff that lasts 2 minutes.\nIf you get two stacks of this debuff then you are in deep trouble. The boss will pierce his blade into your flesh and starts flailing you around. Your party should back away because they will take damage during the massacre. After he finishes beating you to death he will target one of the furthest party member and fling your dead corpse towards your ally killing both in the process.\nYour party can dodge this if you can time it right. Then finally he\u0026rsquo;ll finish it off with Normal Attack #5. Hell is over now.\nIf this becomes an issue then assign the order on who takes debuff while you wait for the 2 minute debuff to be over.\n⚠️ Burn Phase (Hard Mode) - Only happens in Hard Mode.\nOnce the boss reaches below 15% a 2 minute timer will begin counting down. Once the timer reaches zero he will go into frenzy mode where he becomes incredibly fast. Basic attacks Attack Pattern Visual Aid - There are several patterns to this attack so you need to know how it looks like and have quick reflexes to avoid getting hit.\nPattern A only swings his weapon down once and that\u0026rsquo;s the end of it. Pattern B is when he swings his weapon down, pauses for a brief moment, and then launches a side sweeping wave attack on either side. The side sweep attack will knock you back and if you get hit by this in Hard Mode you\u0026rsquo;ll get a bleed that can be cleansed. Pattern C is when he swings his weapon down and either does a front or back slam that does heavy damage and it cannot be blocked. You\u0026rsquo;ll need quick reflexes whenever you see this happening. Once you get familiar fighting him multiple times, you can just look at his stance and the way he swings his weapon down and you\u0026rsquo;ll immediately know what he\u0026rsquo;ll do.\nAttack Pattern Sequences\nAttack Pattern One If he twirls his weapon around, then he\u0026rsquo;s preparing to attack three times in a row on one of the following patterns below: Left \u0026gt; Right \u0026gt; Back Left \u0026gt; Back \u0026gt; Right Right \u0026gt; Back \u0026gt; Front Right \u0026gt; Left \u0026gt; Front Attack Pattern Two If he begins with a front or back slam attack out of nowhere then he\u0026rsquo;s preparing to execute one of the following patterns below: Front \u0026gt; Right \u0026gt; Back Front \u0026gt; Left \u0026gt; Back Back \u0026gt; Left \u0026gt; Right Back \u0026gt; Front \u0026gt; Right Once you understand these patterns you\u0026rsquo;ll naturally get used to knowing what he\u0026rsquo;ll do before it even happens.\nStab Combination - There are two patterns to this attack.\nHe\u0026rsquo;ll do a stab attack and then a 360 swing knocking nearby people back. He\u0026rsquo;ll do a stab attack and follows up with an uppercut where you must get to the inside the donut. You can i-frame the explosion if you can\u0026rsquo;t make it in time. Ressbait(double circle) - This is VERY important to healers because you are expected to be targeted by this often.\nThis usually targets the person that are furthest from the boss. Using Resurrection skills (Hard Mode only) will automatically trigger this attack if the boss isn\u0026rsquo;t doing anything else. This may only work up to two times in a row. The first AoE circle will be stationary so you will have time to simply move out. The second AoE circle will follow you until it explodes no matter where you go so you must i-frame this at the precise moment or if you are a Mystic then you could use Corruption Ring (glyphed) to take half damage to survive if you are having trouble timing the i-frame. The timing to i-frame the second AoE is right after the visual of the first AoE ring disappears. However in hard mode once he gets a power buffs you have to dodge a bit earlier.\nEveryone has Circle - Just i-frame right before the 2nd ripple touches the edge of the circle.\nPeek-a-boo - He\u0026rsquo;ll disappear behind your DPS group to try and flank you.\nSpecial attacks Power Up - He\u0026rsquo;ll get a buff at 60%, 40%, and 20%.\nMessage shown on the center of your screen: ℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Dakuryon is gathering energy. Power and Attack Speed will increase per stack. That means specific attacks where you had to time your i-frame will be much sooner so keep that in mind. Shield Phase - Triggers on 70% and 50%.\nMessage shown on the center of your screen: ℹ️ \u0026ldquo;Dakuryon has a new target! Boss will target the person with the highest aggro (aka the tank) and that person have a few seconds to get as far away from the boss as possible.\nIn hard mode you have little time to get away compared to normal mode. You\u0026rsquo;ll know you have it if you have a creepy eye displayed above your head. Tank will be stunned when time is up and the boss will slowly run towards the tank while the boss has a shield on himself.\nThe amount of time your group has to break the shield determines how far the tank is away from the boss.\nIf your group manages to break the shield on time before reaching the tank, the tank will live. If your group failed to break the shield on time, the boss will stab the tank and fling his body towards another person killing both of them. Anybody else that gets near will also die as well so stay away from someone that has a purple circle. Regardless if you succeed or failed on this mechanic, the boss will do Normal Attack #5 afterwards.\nSources Yosha\u0026rsquo;s SS Guide "},"title":"Shadow Sanguinary (Hard)"},"/dungeon-guide/mt/timescape-hard/":{"data":{"":"","final-boss-valona#Final Boss: Valona":"","first-boss-hemera#First Boss: Hemera":"","pathway#Pathway":"","second-boss-tempas#Second Boss: Tempas":"","sources#Sources":"\nTimespheres Ball 3 will be shieldless and the other two will be protected with a reflective shield.

First Boss: Hemera Key Mechanics ⚠️ Your tank must bring the boss one of the spheres around the room.\nPosition the boss so DPS can hit the boss without hitting sphere. Spheres and Shield - When entering the room, you’ll be faced with Hemera and by default, it is protected by a reflective shield.\nPlayers will receive 10% maximum HP as damage when attacking Hemera with an active shield. Once the sphere dies, it will release an aura that will deal 10,000 damage a second and you will need to move onto the next.\n2. North West\rThis sphere will periodically debuff players with a damage over time and the same Bleed/Sleep effect as the mini game. It is not recommended to use this sphere, unless needed.\n1.

When he lands, he will also deal a moderately high amount of damage. Out Take - Hemera will flap his wings and pushes players outwards with strong wind currents.\nPathway You must kill enough BAMs to fill the entire bar, then you may interact with the device at the end of the path to proceed. This reveal a pathway to the next boss, you will need to climb a vine. Second Boss: Tempas Key Mechanics ⚠️ Tank the boss against the wall or circular motion.\nHowever, the tank must be able to get out and avoid the breath. Storm Incarnate - Tempas shouts\nℹ️ “Fools! I am the storm incarnate!” And then jumps, this causes a shockwave across the field.\nInflicts a fixed amount of damage and a MP decaying debuff which can be cleansed. Second or two later after Tempas lands, multiple Kuma Statues will fire lightning bolts at players so be prepared to dodge.

Jump - Tempas will jump and slam onto the ground.This will send players into the air if not outright oneshotting you.\nMake sure to iframe. Breath - Tempas will deal an electric breath attack at a player.\nThe breath attack will leave three electric puddles on the ground. This debuff will give you an aura which can damage nearby party members. This can be cleansed.

Final Boss: Valona When entering the room, you’ll notice that the floor is split into 3 parts. An Inner Ring, Center Ring and Outer Ring.\nThey’ll move around when you first encounter a boss.\nKey Mechanics These are the Sun tile, Devil tile and Goddess tile. (Do not be confused by the floating cubes, pay attention to the walls). During the fight, one of the walls will light up, the Sun will glow red, the Devil will glow purple and the Goddess will glow green. Your party must then cooperate and align the floors so that they are facing the appropriate wall.\nAll three floor’s alignment pieces must be facing that wall. Successfully completing one of these will give your party members a buff that lasts until the timer ticks zero again. ℹ️ Sun: Regenerates HP over time. Stamina does not decrease. Goddess: Increases Defense. Restores the HP+MP to 100% and allowing dead players to revive. Devil: Restores 100% MP every 15 seconds. Rotating and aligning the floors - During the fight, a wall will glow it’s respective color.\nOuter Ring - The outer ring can be rotated by destroying a Time Device on the outer edges of the map. Destroying one will rotate the outer floor once in a clockwise motion. (Devil \u0026gt; Goddess \u0026gt; Sun \u0026gt; Devil). Destroying all 3 Time Devices will announce :\nℹ️ “The World Seal draws upon the power of the worlds.” After five seconds, Yana receives a buff which increases its defense and party members will receive a deadly DoT. Healers should cleanse the party and Plague/Regress Yana. Middle Ring - Yana will shout :\nℹ️ “Open your mind to all of time and space!” And proceed with a ring shape explosion on the center ring.\nWhen a player stands inside this attack, they must take damage and survive, then the middle ring will rotate counter-clockwise (Sun \u0026gt; Goddess \u0026gt; Devil \u0026gt; Sun). In order for players to survive, players must share the damage by standing in the damage zone together. Inner Ring - You’ll notice another bar when fighting Yana.This bar can fill up to 100.\nThis bar will fill up when you attack the boss. When the bar is full, “A Stone Sigil Becomes Active” will be shown and you will be able to interact with Yana (by pressing “F”). This will rotate the inner ring clockwise (Devil \u0026gt; Goddess \u0026gt; Sun \u0026gt; Devil). Failing Core mechanic Yana will receive a specific buff depending on which wall is glowing.\nIt is not recommended that you fail any and it’ll make the fight harder.\nℹ️ Sun Yana will receive a shield and players will be blinded with a periodic flash. Goddess Yana will receive a 30% attack speed buff and 100% increased defense. Devil Restores 100% MP every 15 seconds. The entire party receives a debuff which will cause a fatal death after 10 seconds every 15 seconds, if failed to be cleansed. Basic attacks Swipe - Yana will swipe to a side.\nFront clap - Claps in front towards the tank. Hits twice.\nDodge all the claps to unlock an achievement. Dice Attacks - Yana will use his dice to attack players, combos include smashing them in front and them behind and throwing them at the person with the highest aggro.\nSpin - Yana will spin around and proceed to juggle its cubes, spinning them at high speeds around it.\nThis can deal a lot of damage and potentially kill melee players, so it is best to avoid this by escaping. Leash - From time to time, if no players are nearby, Yana will leash a player saying :\nℹ️ “Come closer, little mote!” Ripple - After 60% HP, Yana will occasionally slam into the ground, releasing 3 consecutive waves.\nCannot be iframed but does mediocre damage. Special attacks Tile Mix-Up - At any point past 85% HP, Yana will glow bright purple, shout :\nℹ️ “Who are you to touch my statue?” And attempt to mix up the floor.You must interrupt her by stunning.\nFailure to do so will cause Yana to slam his dice into the ground, moving either the Outer or Inner Ring once. Black Hole - Yana will place a black hole on a player and will stay on the ground for a while.\nEntering this black hole will cause players to be teleported to a Time Device on the outer edges of the field. Yana’s Minion - Adds will spawn and run to the person with the highest aggro, these will explode when they are within 7m and deal damage.\nYana will say : ℹ️ “Come, my beautiful children!” To announce them spawning in soon.\nTime Cage - You will be notified with :\nℹ️ “Who is so bold as to enter my realm?” And a purple cage will appear around the inner floor ring. Next she will say : ℹ️ “My power has been gathering in this realm!” And proceed to eject mass amounts of energy, killing anyone still left inside. If you are trapped inside, you can use a Black Hole to escape.

Then, he will bury underground and pop up near the person with aggro. This attack is instant death. Basic attacks Right/Left Scratch - Attacks the person with aggro. Nothing special.\nFury Swipes - hit attack. Alternates right and left 6 times.\nClap - His eyes will flash red, signalling this attack. This attack will inflict stun, so it must be iframed.\nIt cannot be blocked. Inflicts Stun Sonic Spin - His eyes will flash red, curl up and spins like sonic. This attack tends to move through tanks at the end despite holding block up, but sometimes it won’t.\nStunning Pounce - He will jump backward, then leap forward to stun anyone who gets hit. This must be iframed.\nIf someone is stunned, the boss will face that person to attack with fury swipes. In Hard mode, the stun CANNOT be cleansed. Quite deadly, but can survive through it with healer’s proper support. Special attacks Reinforcements - The message :\nℹ️ “Kavador calls for reinforcements.” Will appear on the screen.He will roar and then jump up to slam on the ground. This attack covers entire field, so you must time your iframe.\nThen, similar to how Fulminar had Pizza cutter mechanic, this one also summons blue Argonhogs around the map which will roll straight across like sonic. Oneshot in Hard mode. Bad Breath - He will sideswipe to turn to a random target.\nThen he will lock onto the person with secondary aggro to spit out a large cone shaped AoE. Hurts a lot in Hard mode. Fart - You will notice purple gas building up around him. He will fart in a straight line behind as soon as his wings flap a bit.\nSecond Boss: Prokyon Key Mechanics Rock Pile - At certain point of combat, he will jump up then land with a huge pile of rocks. When he lands, you will receive moderate damage and get pushed back.\nPLEASE DO NOT BREAK THE ROCK PILE. If you do not have at least 1 of these, your raid is doomed for wipe mechanic. Try to move away from the rock pile as you fight the boss. Any attack can potentially destroy it, so moving away from the debris is a must so that everyone can safely DPS without damaging the debris. The recommended positioning is to form a line in a order of tank – boss – party – rock pile. The tank can choose to circle around the map as the boss places rocks on the map. “You’re no fun anymore.” - Same as Debris mechanic where he jumps up to place down a pile of rocks.\nHowever, you will notice that he will target a random person indicated by secondary aggro. He will jump toward this person instead of landing in place. Hide and Seek - With the message :\nℹ️ “Begone! And never come back!” With this quote, he will lift his right arm and there will be a straight blue line stretching from any rock piles indicating a safe zone.\nThis is when you must hide behind the rock pile (inside the blue line) to avoid the full room AoE — you have roughly 6 seconds to do so. It will kill you instantly. TL;DR : Run to blue zone Away with you - With message :\nℹ️ “Argh! Away with you!” All of the debris will detonate in 10m radius.\nOneshot Basic attacks Right foot, Left Foot – He will stomp right foot then left foot toward the person with aggro.\nRight swing, Left Swing – He will swipe with his right arm then left arm toward the person with aggro.\nSide Swing – He will look on his right or left side and throw rocks almost immediately as he swings his right or left arm depending on the direction of which side he looked over.\nSimply iframe it. Back Swing – He will look behind over his right or left shoulder and throw rocks behind him as he swings his right or left arm depending on the direction of which shoulder he looked over.\nSimply iframe it. Special attacks Hammer – Concentrates rocks from his body to form a hammer on his right hand, then slams toward person with aggro.\nMake sure this attack DOES NOT hit the rock pile. Laser - He will randomly target one person and continuously aim at that person until it fires a laser.\nThe laser will also leave a trail, inflicting damage if stepped on. Be careful NOT to aim where the rock pile is. Boulder Throw - Creates a boulder from its body and slams it in front.\nSimply iframe it. Cannot be blocked. Overwhelming power - With message :\nℹ️ “This power is overwhelming!” He will whip one of the targets on the map. Hitting rock pile with this attack will cause it to detonate so be careful where you are making him aim.\nLast Boss: Veldeg Really pay attention to your surroundings so that you do not position yourself to a disadvantage. Your combat zone will be limited and it may put quite a bit of stress on healer if they or other party members are not experienced enough with the game.\nKey Mechanics Pylons - Once it is destroyed, it will create a large engraving that inflicts damage if you stand on it when the engraving on the floor is filled up.\nThis limits your combat area, so be careful! In Hard Mode, the puddles are much larger, and it inflicts 200k damage. Also, in Hard mode, there is an achievement for defeating Veldeg after breaking all pylons before the boss HP falls below 50%. Smash With quote :\nℹ️ “Smash” Then he will aim at one of the pylons to destroy it. There’s no way to stop him from doing this. Don’t chase after him as he will return to the person with aggro.\nBoom! - With quote :\nℹ️ “Boom!” A full room AoE attack. Iframe after he lifts both hands above his head to slam the ground for massive attack.\nYou can ignore this and continue to DPS as long as you get healed; HOWEVER, do keep track of this attack because on every 3rd time he use this attack, you will be knocked airborne if you fail to iframe it. He will immediately follow up with a body slam which will push you back. If you happen to land on the puddle made by destroyed pylon, you are good as dead. The timing to avoid this is to iframe a bit after he jumps. Also, if someone did not die from getting knocked airborne, the boss will randomly target anyone who was airborne to spit at that person to make sure his target is dead. Dispel phase - With the message of :\nℹ️ “Beware…” A fiery AoE will surround him at 10m radius which will inflict 10k per tick. Healers must watch the boss’s buff bar as he will gain a 6 second debuff that looks like Berserker’s Leaping strike icon.\nWhen he has this buff, the healer must use Plague of Exhaustion or Regression to remove this buff. Since he will receive this buff twice, it is a good idea to assign the order in which healer will dispel it first. Failure to dispel his buff will result in possibility of wipe as it will buff him tremendously. After the 6 seconds are up he will do a huge AoE attack. Basic attacks Left Axe – Strikes with his left arm once.\nRight Hammer and Single Slam – Strikes with his right arm once, then gathers both arms to slam once.\nRight Hammer and Left Swipe – Strikes with his right arm once and briefly pauses before he delivers a full swing with his left hand.\nLeft Axe and Double Slam – Chops the person with aggro with his axe and slams twice with both arms. The second slam has a bit of range, so people at the back may get hit by this attack.\nRight back swing – A full swing that will knock you back. Simply iframe.\nSpecial attacks Spin2Win – He spin on his right hand while having his left hand out for a spinning attack. This attack is the circle – donut AoE attack, which you must move in or out to avoid it.\nCannot Block. Inflicts Bleed debuff Kamehameha – He will select a random target. As the name implies, he charges up for an attack that will blow away anyone within the straight line in front of him.\nIt pushes you back, so try not to make him aim this attack toward the destroyed pylons which has a puddle. Cannot Block Sonic spin – He looks over his shoulder similar to how he’d initiate his backswing, but instead he will curl a bit and jump for a sonic spin like the first boss.\nThis is deadly for people at the back, not so much for the person in front (hopefully this is a tank). Inflicts Bleed debuff Fall – With quote :\nℹ️ “Fall before me!” He will select one random target which he will focus on until he delivers a large cone AoE toward the target, then his behind.\nCannot Block. Moderate damage. This will also inflict Stun on top of the damage.

However, if Darkan’s HP falls below 50%, the Lesser Generators will be replaced by Greater Generators and Ring of Fire will reset. Annihilation - Break the pylons with this attack so that it creates a safe zone for next attack.\nAbove 50% HP – Prepare to suffer! – One person will be targeted for massive damage. Below 50% HP – If you stand together, you can die together! – Everyone will be targeted for massive damage. Make sure you break the generator so you have space to dodge Darkan\u0026rsquo;s Dust mechanic. Once these pylons are destroyed, they will reappear few moments after Darkan nukes the inner area with Dust. 🚫 One shot if failed to dodge.\nCannot be blocked, but can be iframed. Lesser Pylon = Requires 1 person to break it Greater Pylon = Requires 4 or more people to break it Invincible Pylon = Invincible. It will have a blue shield. Dust - He will cover almost entire area with a one-shot AoE.\nIf you and/or your party successfully broke pylons from Annihilation Mechanic, there will be a safe zone to avoid this massive AoE attack. However, in case the party failed, you can attempt to time your iframe/movement skills to move into the fire then quickly move out of it after Darkan blasts the area. 🚫 One-shot. (does 1,000,000 damage)\nCannot be avoided. Basic attacks Left or Right Slam - He will attack the person with primary aggro with his Left or Right sword. Swipe - This can also be Left or Right. He will strike down his glowing sword toward the person with aggro while lifting the other hand and pause briefly. At this moment you have to look at his pose to determine which side is safe before he swipes a 180º attack that inflicts heavy damage, bleed debuff, as well as pushing you away. To safely avoid this attack, you simply move to the side where his blade is down or use a iframe ability (roll, backstep, etc) Inflicts Bleed Debuff, Heavy Damage Back Spin - Darkan will swipe his back as he spin around, inflicting Bleed debuff.\nInflicts Bleed Debuff Eviscerate - Darkan’s 2-hit combo. He will quickly strike down his glowing swords that shoot a blast wave, then immediately follow up with another blast wave.\nInflicts Bleed Debuff, Heavy Damage Drill - He will charge toward the person with aggro like a drill, hitting multiple times if you don’t avoid it.\nDPS should be careful behind him as his wings will deal damage if they are too close. This can be forced to trigger when the person with aggro is far away. Claw - This can be either Random target or Res bait. He will face the target and throw his swords, creating a huge claw mark on the floor.\nHis sword inflicts Bleed debuff,while the claws on the floor are DoT (Damage over Time) until they disappear.\nSwords inflict Bleed Debuff\nClaw marks are DoT\nCannot be blocked.\nSpecial attacks Triple Swipe - He will Swipe three times as he shouts\nℹ️ “Fools, all of you!”\n“You’ll die here!”\n“I AM INVINCIBLE!” There is no static order of his swipes as they are completely random.\nHeavy Damage\nInflicts Bleed Debuff\nVery Dangerous\nAway with you! - He will swipe toward the person with aggro, then fly up to put down AoE (Area of Effect) attack in either order: Donut – Circle Circle – Donut It is strongly advised to stand around ~7m away from Darkan during this attack. Dark Heart - Darkan will glow purple, stab his swords on the ground ,curl up, then roar, blasting a wave that inflicts damage, silence and bleed debuffs.\nHealers should try to prepare their cleanse just incase.\nInflicts Silence and Bleed Debuffs\nSilence can be blocked with blue shield.\nSecond Boss: Revived Dakuryon Key Mechanics Pizza Slices - Dakuryon will run to the center of the map and shout:\nℹ️ “I call upon the power of dark mana!” After a short while, pizza slices will flash around the map. Stand on the blank slice! its the safe spot. Multiple AoE Patterns - Dakuryon will run to the center of map and shout\nℹ️ “Dark mana explosion!!” In few moments, there will be multiple AoE placed around the map.\nMobs - He will summon mobs around the map as he swings around his spear. If you don’t kill these mobs, they will turn into Cursed Archdevans that shoot red balls intermittently, so eliminate them.\nCage - During cage, instead of dodging the orange patterns immediately, just focus on memorizing them first; it won’t harm you at all.\nHowever, as soon as the 5th pattern ends, the purple pattern will appear in the exact same order as the orange pattern, and this is the one that kills you. Debuff in Cage - You will also see small red skull debuff on your buff bar, with small number indicating how many stacks you have.\nIf you have these stacks of curse, you MUST TAKE HIT from the patterns. Basic attacks Stab, Wave and Donut - When your party enters, Dakuryon will lunge his spear toward the first person that enters the combat zone, launch a wave that flies in straight path, then proceed to place a donut AoE. Stab and Toss - He will randomly target (usually someone who has a stack), stab, and throw that target across the room. Left or Right - His most basic attack will be a simple swinging motion with his spear to strike down toward the person with aggro.\n🚫 The Swipes will push you away and inflict a bleed debuff.\nThe Slams inflict heavy damage. Special attacks Purple Balls - After he reaches certain amount of HP, purple balls as shown below begin to appear in the map.\nWhen you come in contact with these balls, they will inflict flat damage after few seconds.\nWhen there are 4 of these balls floating around, Dakuryon will says “BOOM!”. Then, these balls will create a yellow AoE around 15m radius, and detonate.\nExplosion can be iframed.\nStack Debuff - Dakuryon strikes down his spear on the ground twice, which has a vacuum (pull) effect on the first hit.\nThe target debuff does nothing when a party member only takes it once, but when taken twice, they will be stunned and Imperator will leap towards him/her, stab and smash on the ground multiple times before throwing toward the farthest party member. 🚫 2 Debuff Stacks mean death\nTarget throw can be iframed if timed correctly\nFollowup AoE can be iframed Priest can save the targeted person if they time their Divine Intervention correctly, just before the person gets stunned. Double Circle AoE - Lakan’s Authority - This is the same as gathering energy buff he gets in Shadow Sanguinary, increasing his Power and Attack Speed. Shield Phase - When his HP falls below a certain amount, the person with the aggro must run as far away from Imperator as possible. The targeted person will have an eye above their head as shown in image on right (bad quality but you can see the eye mark).\nThat person will be stunned, and Dakuryon will run toward him/her while having a shield. If the party fails to break the shield, Imperator will stab the stunned person and throw him/her to the farthest person. If succeeding in breaking the shield, Dakuryon won’t do anything after he reaches his target. Pathway – Mutated Perimos Here, you can choose to either (A) fight Perimos along with a few Archdevan mobs, or (B) fight many Archdevan mobs while skipping Perimos.\nFor Hard Mode, option (B) will be much quicker.\nOption A - Pay attention when you’re fighting against Perimos. There aren’t much notable attack patterns as they aren’t much of a threat, so just try to defeat him as you’d normally do.\nAfter you defeat Perimos, he will say one of the following lines:\nℹ️ Thank you… for this release…\nBeware the… red lightning…\nBeware the mark… of Lakan… These lines will help you figure out Key Mechanics for the next boss: Lakan.\nOption B - Going this path will allow you to skip fighting Perimos, and instead fight a handful of Archdevan mobs. Clear these, and then there will be more mobs at the top of a staircase. Clearing all these mobs here will summon a teleportal that leads to the Final Boss. Last Boss: Lakan Key Mechanics Targets two nearest party members with a debuff.\rAfter few seconds, everyone will receive a 3 second stun.\rAfter few seconds, everyone will have a bomb on their head with 4 second debuff. Debuff - Players with this debuff will have an eye floating above them, and they will also bleed 3% of max HP every second. This debuff lasts 4 minutes, and if you get this debuff twice, you will die. Spread - While stunned, a large circle will form around each player, which inflicts 50k damage each, so make sure to spread out. Gather - Everyone must gather up quickly as those bombs will explode in a donut AoE around them. Players must gather fast and healers must cleanse immediately, or else anyone not cleansed will detonate and cause a massive AoE damage. After 40 seconds of combat, Lakan will float and say:\nℹ️ “I mark you!” He will do this mechanic every 1 minute unless he says “I am no mere mortal foe!”\nPattern Reversal (\u003c50% HP)\rWhen Lakan’s HP falls below 50%, a system message will appear again, but the order of the Chaos Mechanic pattern will now be **REVERSED**.\rNote: Keep in mind that this message will be randomized! FEEL THE ICY TOUCH OF MY EMPTY SOUL… (\u003c30% HP) Randomly under 90% , he will float in air and say\nℹ️ “Feel the icy touch of my empty soul!” There will be a ring closing in toward Lakan, which inflicts deadly damage.Iframe it.\nDO NOT go near him after avoiding the ring. When this 5 second buff timer icon (see image on right) appears, healers must use their dispell skill to prevent Lakan from creating a shield. LAKAN’S SOUL WORLD\rWhen Lakan’s HP falls below 30%, you will notice that Lakan is now silvery, and the arena has turned blue.\nAll Chaos mechanics will be the inverse. Soul Saturation Gauge\rWhenever Lakan initiates Soul World, this gauge will **fill up by 20** each time.\rUNDO the Soul World\rLakan will also UNDO soul world with the quote: **“Ha! Not bad!”** This time, you must **SLEEP** (not plague/regress) Lakan.\rBasic attacks Sword (chop) – Shield (smash) – Sword (R swing) – Back Spin (cone) – Sword (thrust) -\nOn the third part when he swings his sword from right to left, he will pause very briefly before he backspins like Darkan, but this time, there will be a large cone attack.\nSword (chop) – Shield (smash) – Sword (L cross) – Shield (stun) – Back Kick (cone) -\nOn the third part, he will swing his sword to form an X shape starting with Left diagonal slash then Right. Then he will lift his shield and slam it upright on the ground, creating small AoE that stuns anyone near him, then he will immediately follow up with a back kick that covers large cone AoE behind him.\nShield (smash) – Sword (chop) – Sword (R cross) – Shield (cone) -\nOn the third part, he will swing his sword to form an X shape starting with Right diagonal slash then Left. Cone on last hit with Shield will cause 5 wave AoE, starting with 10m radius circle, then 10~20m donut, 20~30 donut, 30~40 donut and 40~50 donut. Shield Rally – Sword (R cross)x3 – Sword (stabs) - When he strikes his shield it does nothing, but it tells you that he will start slashing like a maniac.\nRandom Target Claw Patterns - The claw attack itself is a 2 hit attack. Lakan will charge energy into his sword and then throw it, splits into 3, leaving a claw mark on the ground, then he will retrieve it after a moment.\nStop – Face random target – Claw He just pauses shortly and turns around to face random target.\nThis occurs mostly due to res bait. Backswing Turn – Face random target – Claw He makes a large swing as he turns around, then faces toward random target. To add, this tends to target farthest person who is within ~17m radius. Shield (Slam) – Laser (from his shield) – Backswing Turn – Face random target – Claw His shield glows pink and attacks by thrusting his shield forward. He will pause briefly as the shield’s glow is concentrated and shoots a laser. Special attacks Double 5-way shot - He will curl up with a small puddle under him, then launch 5-way projectile around him\nℹ️ “You cannot defend against me.” There are several ways to trigger this: ⚠️ Person with aggro dies\nPerson with aggro is too far away (~8m?)\nPerson with aggro loses aggro\nWhen he does or undoes soul realm Healers can prevent this with res bait. Circle or Donut - A quote will pop up in the middle of the screen: ℹ️ “Begone!” With a large sword swing motion, he will spin around with either Red or Purple swipe surrounding him.\nPurple swipe - He will place a Circle AoE (~8m); stay away from him. Orange swipe - He will place Donut AoE (8m~20m); hug him. Sources Essential Mana "},"title":"Velik's Sanctuary (Hard)"},"/general/":{"data":{"":" ℹ️ Select something from the menu to learn more!

From v81 with the addition of Partners and onward, both are accessed from the Companion UI.\nPets that have special Abilities can perform tedious tasks such as looting drop items, looting gold, gathering resources, or providing extra storage. Pets also have Skills and their description is of the following : Ability Description Auto-Caring Uses a pet food or present when your pet\u0026rsquo;s Energy / Stamina drops below the percentage indicated. Use the Auto-Caring % button in the Companion List to adjust your pet\u0026rsquo;s settings. Auto-Gather Gathers all gathering objects around you. Consumes 20% fewer production points. Increases gathering speed. Auto-Gold-Loot Loots all gold around you. Auto-Loot Loots all items around you. Auto-Potion (HP) Automatically uses a [Minor, Major, Prime] Recovery Potable or Health Potion when your HP drops to a certain amount. Auto-Potion (MP) Automatically uses a [Minor, Major, Prime] Replenishment Potable or Divine Infusion when your MP drops to a certain amount. Auto-Use Potion Automatically uses Health Potions or Divine Infusions when your HP or MP drops to the designated percentage. BAF Auto-Fishing Adds a chance to catch a BAF when you are Auto-Fishing. Increases max Energy/Stamina by 20% Special Storage Access your pet\u0026rsquo;s special storage.\n[Caution] Can only access when possessing a pet with the corresponding ability. Pets can grow and level up by feeding them a big variety of items including Talents, Feedstock, Gear and various food items among many others. Once a Pet grows to Level 10, it can use an Evolution Core to evolve into a random Partner.\nTwo Pets can also be combined to become a random Pet, or even a random Partner at a low chance. The higher the grades of the Pets, the more likely it is for the two to be combined into a Partner. Note that combining two Grade 10 Pets is guaranteed to yield a random Partner. Evolving or Combining Pets will lose their Pet Skills. Probability of obtaining a Partner of a certain rarity has been modified in v104.01.02 patch notes, leaning towards higher rarity. Partners are specialized Companions. What makes Partners most valuable is their Bond Skill, which provides valuable combat support. Partners also have one random passive skill called Gifted Skill that can be triggered randomly depending on how much Stamina the Partner has. Partners can Train to take and learn Pet Skills from different Companions, so make sure to take Pet Skills from Pets before Evolving or Combining Pets.\nPartners start at Grade 1 and Fellowship 1 and can be Promoted by consuming another Partner. Promoting a Partner increases its Grade by 1, and improves Fellowship by a random value. Partners cannot go past Grade 10, and therefore can only be promoted 9 times.\nAt level 66, you can get your first Partner from Hatching a Partner quest given by Loomey the Wanderering Scholar in Highwatch. While the obtained Partner does not gain more Fellowship from being Promoted, it can be used to promote another Partner.\nFellowship Fellowship is what determines how effective your Partner\u0026rsquo;s Bond Skill is. By promoting your Partner, Fellowship of your Partner will increase. While Fellowship caps at 50, the amount of Fellowship increased at each Promotion varies depending on the Grade of the sacrificed Partner.\nPartner Grade Fellowship Gained 1-2 3-4 3-4 4-5 5-7 4-6 8-10 6 While dependent on RNG, it is highly recommended to Promote a Partner sacrificing Grade 8 or higher Partners in order to maximize the potential Fellowship gain. Promoting a Partner with Grade 8 Partners guarantee 46 Fellowship.\nFor an uncommon Partner, 39 Fellowship is the minimum to maintain Bond Skill indefinitely, whereas for Rare and Superior Partner, 37 and 35 Fellowship is the minimum, respectively.\nBond Skill : Power Select Partners can provide Power for their Bond Skill. Depending on the rarity of your Partner and how high the Partner\u0026rsquo;s Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies. Four Partners - Marie, Kuncun, Cocomin, and Loo - have been released to have Bracing Force as their Bond Skill, which increases Power for a set duration of time.\nBond Skill : Amplification Select Partners can provide Amplification for their Bond Skill. Depending on the rarity of your Partner and how high the Partner\u0026rsquo;s Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies. Two Partners - Rico and Eco - have been released to have Robust Energy and Vibrant Energy as their Bond Skill, which increases Physical Amplification and Magical Amplication (respectively) for a set duration of time.\nSpecial Partners Special Superior Partners have been added to the game, providing Eternal Force for their Bond Skill. Depending on how high the Partner\u0026rsquo;s Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies. Three Partners - RK-9, Kalligar and Lumikan - have been released to have Eternal Force as their Bond Skill, which increases Power for a set duration of time. Unlike Bracing Force, Eternal Force persists through death, meaning the Bond Skill does not expire upon death.\nPlease refer to Bracing Force table for the obtained Power and its duration for these Special Partners.\nGifted Skill Each Partner species is restricted to a set of Gifted Skills.\nA Gifted Skill Change Voucher is needed in order to change a Partner\u0026rsquo;s Gifted Skill. The said item can be purchased with Mystery Market Coins from wandering Mystery Merchants randomly appearing in Val Oriyn, Northern Arun.\nGifted Skill Description Urgent Recovery I-III May recover [20,000, 25,000, 30,000] HP per second for [3, 4, 5] seconds.

In order to catch fish, Bait and Fishing Rod are necessary. Both can be purchased with Gold from a [Fishing Supplies] merchant, and higher grade Fishing Rods and Baits can be exchanged with Angler Tokens from an [Angler Token Vendor].\n[Fishing Supplies] merchant and [Angler Token Vendor] are located at fisheries and major cities.\nFish caught can be delivered to select NPCs for Gold or goods, or can be dismantled to obtain Fish Filet (Arborean Fish) or Kirash Filet (Exodor Fish) which can be used as Cooking materials.\nFish caught cannot be traded and fishing does not impact PvE or PvP. Basics With Bait and Fishing Rod in hand, players can head over to a fishery to start fishing. Before casting a fishing line with the Fishing Rod, Bait must be toggled on.\nThis can be done through Inventory, players can right-click toggle to activate a bait - appropriate effect icon indicates that the bait is active. Once toggled on, players can right-click the Fishing Rod to cast a line. Fishing Rod can be right-click held to cast the line farther away.\nBoth Bait and Fishing Rod can be registered to a skill slot. When a fish bites, players can press the interact key (default : F) to manually catch the fish, or wait a few minutes for the system to automatically catch the fish for you. Manual fishing is a lot quicker but requires more effort as difficulty increases with the grade of the fish.\nManual fishing In order to catch fish manually, players must play a mini-game. The key objective of the mini-game is to move the square on the left towards the reel on the right by reeling the fish appropriately within a time limit.\nFish can be pulled to the right by holding the interact key (default : F) and Fish must overlap with the square in order to move it.\nDifficulty of the mini-game increases relative to the grade of the fish to be caught - the square to shift to the right decreases in width, and the fish to be caught can resist more strongly and more often.\nDifficulty can be decreased using Fish Salad. After manual fishing, the system does not recast the fishing line for the player.\nAutomatic fishing Instead of pressing the interact key (default : F) to manually fish, fishing can be automated when left idle for 3 minutes of auto-fishing time. After waiting and the fish is automatically caught, and the system recasts a fishing line.\nPlayers can switch to manual fishing at any point during the auto-fishing time.\nAutomatic fishing will continue until players runs out of bait or inventory is full. Auto-fishing time can be reduced by using Fairywing Rod, or equipping Angler\u0026rsquo;s Whiskers Generally auto-fishing cannot catch BAF natively, and requires a Companion with BAF Auto-Fishing ability to be summoned.\nBig-Ass Fish Rare fish called BAF, short for Big-Ass Fish have a rare chance to bite. BAF can be delivered to a Fish Associated Fishmonger NPC for at least 500 Gold.\nThere are several things that can increase the chance to catch a BAF :\nPremium bait such as Popori Bait or Rainbow Bait (item) Ash Sapling Rod (item) Clover\u0026rsquo;s Luck (item) Backup Fisherman Gifted Skill (Companion) Fishing Rod The most basic Old Fishing Rod can be purchased from a [Fishing Supplies] merchant with Gold, while other higher grade Fishing Rods must be exchanged with Angler Tokens from an Angler Token Vendor and be upgraded.\nOther than the Old Fishing Rod, there are 3 different types of Fishing Rods : Xermetal, Ash Sapling, Fairywing Rod. These Fishing Rods have special effects that affect fishing and can be upgraded up to tier VIII.\nFishing Rod Effect Xermetal Rod Increase the chance to catch a high-grade fish\nDecreases wait time Ash Sapling Rod Increase the chance to catch a Big-Ass Fish Fairywing Rod Decrease auto-fishing waiting time Bait Bait I can be purchased from a [Fishing Supplies] merchant with Gold.\nBait II-V can only be crafted through the Processing profession.\nBait I~V and Angleworm I-V cannot be used at Exodor fisheries\nPilidium Bait Pilidium Bait can be used exclusively at Exodor fisheries, and can be purchased from a Exodor Justicar Reputation Merchant.\nPlayers are limited to 60 Pilidium baits in inventory Premium bait such as Popori Bait, Rainbow Bait, etc. can be used at both Arborean fisheries and Exodor fisheries.\nAngleworm bait have an additional effect which decreases wait time.

All three gathering professions are automatically learned upon character creation, and start off at level 1 with 0 points. There are 6 levels of gathering and a total of 350 gathering points to be earned. Level 1 requires 100 points to advance to level 2, but from then on leveling requires only 50 points. An indicator of the level of gathering skill can be found in the Gathering tab of the Character Profile. When you get each of the three gathering skill to level 300 you will gain a row of 8 Inventory Expansion slots.\nEvery node you gather will increase your respective gathering skill by 3 points. Gathering a node costs 10 production points(10 PP) and will give you 3-5 of the respective item for that node, with a possible bonus 1-4 of a different material, if applicable. There is a small chance of receiving a high number of material, between 10-14 material. There is no chance to fail when gathering. Gathering of nodes is not restricted by your gathering level. Gathering speed is, however, affected by a players gathering level.\nHow to speed up gathering ? Eating Pickled Verida Root gives you a buff that reduces gathering time by 20%. Using Crude Sickle can decrease your Plant harvesting time by 2 seconds. Using Speedy Gathering Tool can decrease all your harvesting times starting at 2 seconds and be upgraded to 6 seconds.

But there are the other two bosses in the back in the original teleport location. If you want to complete the instance the old way, you can go protect both of the bosses before finally arriving to Banyaka.\nWhen you fight Banyaka, there you have to destroy a red crystal before attacking Banyaka directly. Reward chest will spawn after fight is finished.\nThe First boss mission is to protect guardian from attacking mobs until all crystals where mobs spawn break. Second boss encounter is to defend second guardian while he recovers. You must attack two teraliths to stun them or draw aggro so they won\u0026rsquo;t hit guardian.\nIf you choose to skip the two guardians they get possessed and spawn on sides of Banyaka to do random stun attacks (red rings) during boss fight. Also boss fight gets harder and you have to damage boss himself to bring him down to around 30%.\nMechanics Throughout the fight, he’ll spawn Ghilliedhus which will attack you. They have relatively low health and drop motes which heal and regenerate your MP. These Ghilliedhus can be knocked down and stunned.\nLateral Shockwave - Depending on which side you’re on, Banyakas will send a wave of damage on one half of the field.\nThis is easy to notice and dodge as it’s a slow attack, pay attention to his hands.\nHeavy Blow - You’ll receive a warning message :\n“There will be nothing left of you but ash!” Banyakas will slam his hands on the ground on the left and right side, if you stand near you’ll receive quite a lot of damage.\nYou can easily avoid this mechanic by staying in the middle section. The area of damage is not big and you’ll find yourself not worrying about this mechanic as much. He’ll then proceed to do Frontal Fire Frontal Fire - Banyakas will exert fire in front of him towards Dominolith Shard and the bridge. Dealing damage in that area.\nThis is a fixed position and he can only exert fire down the middle of the field. Bitter Fruits - You’ll receive a warning message :\n“I bear the most bitter fruit!“\rThe field will be split with a red zone and a safe zone. You must get away from Banyakas by heading to the safe outer section of the field as it’s a close range attack.\nYou’ll receive multiple damage and a slowing debuff if hit. Fiery Breath - You’ll receive a warning message:\n“I’ll burn you to ash!“\rThe field will be split with a red zone and a safe zone. You must get close to Banyakas by heading to the safe inner section of the field as it’s a long range attack.\nYou’ll receive multiple damage and a slowing debuff if hit. Tips During boss fight some ghilliedhus mobs spawn. Kill those to get health motes. On last boss the red crystal has its backside outside, towards player. When fight is over it\u0026rsquo;s recommended to exit dungeon with command /reset. That resets dungeon and bosses to allow second run. Fastest way to do two runs is to use scroll again inside dungeon, which teleports you back to Velik, after that do /reset before entering dungeon again. This avoids loading Velika city models.\nMT The Dream Solo content which you can do daily on each of your characters.

You can find a lot of useful items when you go hunt for them.\nAs of now, their locations will not be disclosed. Get in game and look for them!\nCity Merchant City Merchants are merchants located specific in the 4 major cities : Velika, Allemantheia, Kaiator, and Highwatch.City Merchant locations are marked on the minimap, making them easy to find.\nA global system message - that Mystery Merchant Starc has appeared in one of the 4 major cities - signals that the City Merchant associated to the city will open in 5 minutes.\nCity Merchants remain open for 2 hours.\nCity Merchants open every 24 hours, and City Merchants rotate every 6 hours.\nIn other words, one of four City Merchant opens every 6 hours.\nFor instance, if City Merchant in Allemantheia opens at 12:00 then merchant reopens 12:00 the next day. Within the same context, if City Merchant in Allemantheia opens at 12:00 then City Merchant in Highwatch opens 6 hours later at 18:00, and so on at 24:00, then 06:00. The city rotation order is Allemantheia, Highwatch, Velika, and finally Kaiator.\nWandering Merchant Wandering Merchants spawn in rotation around region sets, with exceptions.\nWandering Merchant for each region set spawns every 6 hours, and for each region set, a random region from the region set is selected for the Wandering Merchant to spawn in.\nWandering Merchants spawn rotating through region sets 1-6 in order. That is, Wandering Merchant Foretta or Eteral, which spawns in region set 2, will not spawn before Wandering Merchant Arcun or Viadu, which spawns in region set 1. This applies to Wandering Merchants of other region sets as well.\nWandering Merchant spawns 20 minutes after the Wandering Merchant of the previous region set despawns. For instance, 20 minutes after Mystery Merchant Arcun (region set 1) despawns, Mystery Merchant Foretta or Eteral (region set 2) can spawn.\nWandering Merchant: Island of Dawn Mystery Merchants on Island of Dawn is an exception to the region sets, and spawn on a separate timer.\nGenerally, Mystery Merchant Vardung spawns every 3-4 hours.\nWandering Merchant:City Outskirts Mystery Merchants around major cities is an exception to the region sets, and spawn on a separate timer.\nGenerally, merchants spawn in order of Velika Outskirts, Allemantheia Outskirts, and Kaiator Outskirts with a 4-5 hour term in between spawns.\nSpawn Locations and listings Various items are sold by Mystery Merchants, and varies by region sets.

The maps have a duration of 3 hours from the time of their pickup so you should keep an eye on your inventory for maps. They cannot be traded but they can be stored in a guild bank and other people with guild bank access can take them out.\nHow to use them? Naslow maps are greyed out / inactive until you are in the correct location for their use. There are five Naslow maps. Naslow\u0026rsquo;s Treasure Map [Archive Grounds], Naslow\u0026rsquo;s Treasure Map [Aurum Road], Naslow\u0026rsquo;s Treasure Map [Citadel of Torment], Naslow\u0026rsquo;s Treasure Map [Quarantine Zone], Naslow\u0026rsquo;s Treasure Map [Thrallhold].\nThe detail texts on the map will tell you where to go. \u0026ldquo;Use this map under three trees on the road where Tulufan and Cathedral Passageway meet.

A Hidden Gold Crate, Hidden Silver Crate, and Hidden Wooden Crate. The odds of getting each tier isn\u0026rsquo;t too bad, compared to other loot in TERA. Generally, you\u0026rsquo;ll get:\nSome gems Might get old plates (gold and silver) Old infusion material tokens Harmonious Imbalance design Harmonious Imbalance items Titan\u0026rsquo;s items, used for Etching crafting, but generally useless. Feed them to your pets! And the higher tier boxes will have more than the lower ones.

Higher reputation levels generally require more points than the previous level to progress. Reputation points, just like experience points, are gained through quests and killing various mobs.\nVarious quests and faction-specific rewards are available across the levels, but the player must be able to interact with the faction NPCs to gain access to these rewards. This usually requires Favorable​​​ or better standing.\nLevel Points to levelup Notes Revered 1,000 Access to superior jewelry and superior items Trusted 25,000 Access to pristine crystals Friendly 20,000 Fifth daily quest opens Favorable 15,000 Fourth daily quest opens Neutral 12,000 Third daily quest opens Wavering 9,000 Two daily quests open up Apprehensive 6,000 Can only gain reputation through zone quests Suspicious 3,000 Can only gain reputation through zone quests Gaining reputation You get reputation by completing non-repeatable quests will usually increase your reputation with the quest giver\u0026rsquo;s faction(s) by a fixed number of points. Most of the factions also have special daily quests that give reputation when completed, or special mobs that give reputation when killed.\nFor higher-end factions, a general strategy exists to make a reputation grind as painless as possible. Take the Valsekyr Hunt for example. There are several ways in which to earn reputation for them: doing standard quests, killing mobs in and around Argonea and Granarkus, killing BAMs, and doing daily quests.\nThe Factions Hyderad Legacy The Hyderad Legacy is a faction residing in Bastion devoted to the preservation of the natural world.\nThey give repeating daily missions that award some gold, reputation credits and reputation.

Guild Tower Blueprint can also be purchased from NPC in other major cities : Allemantheia City with NPC: Jarkek Kaiator City with NPC: Frarang To join the battle, players need to talk to [NPC: Brahem] who is a GvG Guide in Velika City - walk from the Ring teleport point forward and you will see him right on the right side near some bushes and a Skycastle model in front of him.\nGeneral Info To enter and build a tower you a guild need to complete weekly guild quest to get enough Valderon tokens.Depending on the Guild size, the amount of Valderon tokens will change.\nSmall guild -\u0026gt; needs 700 from 900 max\nMedium guild -\u0026gt; needs 1100 from 1300 max\nLarge guild -\u0026gt; needs 1500 from 1700 max Character who builds the tower needs correct permission or be a guild master.

Score depends on tower and player kills.If you happen to die in the war zone, you can respawn near your guild’s tower, or the in starting area (if tower is destroyed).\nWinners get honour and glory, also Tanner lion mount for one week (speed 280, but useable in CU area too). Top 3 guilds get golden, silver and bronze lining on their guild icon on title.\nWhile in the Civil Unrest area, weapon skins and other costumes cannot be used and every player will wear an unified costume. This is to improve the game performance so you dont need to worry about it too much.\nEssentials Before the actual start of Civil Unrest you would prefer to stack on needed potions which you can buy from Smuggler inside of the area. You can also buy Painkillers from him which are very useful in bigger battles that you will face! In addition, there are items such as Poison which when used will kill your character immediately (as they deal 1.000.000 flat damage).\nIts recommended to always have some Poison on you, as it makes regrouping much easier. If the respawn point is too far, running back can take a long time - therefore it is recommended to use poison to kill yourself and to return to Dock (Civil Unrest enterance) or choose to go back to the Guild Tower location.\nYou will also need a different mount, which you can buy from Merchant in any major city. Winners of previous Civil Unrest can also use their Tanner mount, which can be ridden inside of Civil Unrest and is generally faster than a basic horse mount.\nGuild BAMs For even more chaos, BAMS monsters spawn during certain intervals.\nLavathus [The Lord of the Lake] Spawns 30 minutes after the start of Civil Unrest, any guild that successfully defeats Lavathus will receive a 20% defense boost buff.\nDrakhan [The Tyrant of Gidd Mountain] Spawns 60 minutes after Civil Unrest starts. Any guild that successfully defeats Drakhan will receive a buff that increases attack power by 5%, but reduces your HP by 10%.\nKaithan [The King of Crabs] Spawns 90 minutes after the start of Civil Unrest, any guild that successfully defeats Kaithan will receive an attack speed buff and increased chance for critical hit by 20%.\nCivil Unrest Rewards The guild that wins will be given a specific amount of Velika City taxes for the past week, divided by 100% and averaged to the guilds ranked 1-5 with the Civil Unrest reward box.\nTax Money received Reward Box Emblem Rank 1 50% Rank 1 Reward Box Golden Rank 2 30% Rank 2 Reward Box Silver Rank 3 10% Rank 3 Reward Box Bronze Rank 4 5% Rank 4 Reward Box - Rank 5 5% Rank 4 Reward Box - Rank 6-10 - - - Rank 11-20 - - - The 1st place will reward box will also reward you with an additional 7-Day Tanner Mount which is the fastest mount available for Civil Unrest area and will also show your guild logo on the sides of his saddle.\nSources\rGameMonday Tera Fandom Gameforge Patch notes 47 Personal Experiences "},"title":"Civil Unrest"},"/general/pvp/rally-quest/":{"data":{"":"","location#Location":"","mt-the-dream-rally-quest#MT: The Dream Rally Quest":"","reward#Reward":"","time-schedule#Time Schedule":"\nRally Quest is a once-per-daily Guild Quest associated with Rally boss monsters that spawn throughout Arborea.
