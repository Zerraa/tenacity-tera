      <description>This time around, we&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing a lot of our time on PvP. We&amp;rsquo;ve snuck in some PvE changes here and there, but those interested in PvE should stay tuned for patches in the next couple of weeks.
Many of the changes are our first steps toward balancing many different aspects of PvP in Menma&amp;rsquo;s TERA. We continue to ask for your patience while we do so, as balancing every part of the game in one patch is not possible.</description>

      <description>There is a lot going on with this patch, so we&amp;rsquo;ll split this design note into two sections with bullet points. Hopefully this&amp;rsquo;ll help highlight what we believe are the most important changes for our players to see. This is the first time since we have joined the team that we&amp;rsquo;ve been making such large notable changes for both PvE and PvP simultaneously.
PvE #We have received a lot of valuable feedback, with a common trend of feeling tired of our current lineup.</description>

      <description>The last year has been a blast, and we as a team have come a long way from when we first started working on this project. We&amp;rsquo;ve learnt a ton, largely in part to your constructive feedback and efforts from the community. We&amp;rsquo;re now looking into taking things to the next level in the coming year. This small patch wraps up a number of events, and it also wraps up a few projects started in the previous year including changes to the Island of Dawn and the boss pet system.</description>

      <description>PVE Content Changes #Design Note
A number of dungeons in the current PVE roster, ranging from entry-level dungeons to dungeons of the highest difficulty, have been reworked to not only bring boss HP values in-line with the balancing of classes that come with Patch 1.4, but should also make content that may previously have been a burden, more enjoyable to run. Naturally, these adjustments are subject to change, so we&amp;rsquo;ll be reviewing the state of content and learning from your feedback in the coming weeks.</description>

      <description>Menma’s Hunter Event (Battle Pass) #After reviewing feedback from the community, we’ve decided to make some significant changes to the Battle Pass system. Alongside a wealth of quality of life improvements, the new Dungeon Mission Box now contains 2 new “Mission Tickets,” allowing players to select specific dungeons they’d like to run. Dungeons within the “Dungeon Group Mission” boxes have also been amended. We hope these changes make it slightly more enjoyable to complete your Battle Pass!</description>
